AB The present study aims at evaluating the potential of synthesized
   biosorbents using NaOH-activated dead leaves of Ficus racemosa (NTFR)
   and Prunus dulcis (NTPD) for the treatment of real industrial effluents
   containing dyes. Kinetic and isotherm studies have been performed to
   establish the important design-related information for the treatment of
   industrial effluent using synthesized biosorbents. The extent of dye
   removal obtained as 99.19% for the studies involving pure dye solution
   of Acid Blue 25 dye with 50mgL(-1) as initial concentration using NTFR
   biosorbent was found to decreasemarginally to 96.72% in the case of real
   effluent with similar dye loading and under similar operating
   conditions. Biosorption capacity for the case of pure Acid Blue 25 dye
   solution obtained as 83.33mgg(-1) also marginallydecreased to
   80.65mgg(-1) for the industrial effluent. Similarly, for the case of
   Acid Green 25 dye, extent of dye removal obtained as 92.09% was found to
   decrease to 84.51% in the case of mixed industrial effluent. In this
   case, reduction in chemical oxygen demand (COD) was also measured and
   compared with that of pure Acid Green 25 dye solution. COD reduction was
   obtained as 53.97% at the optimized dose of 18g/L of NTPD for mixed
   industrial effluent which was lower than 92.05% obtained at the
   optimized biosorbent dose for pure Acid Green 25 dye solution. Langmuir
   and pseudo-second-order model fitted well to the obtained data in the
   present study. The obtained results confirmed potential of synthesized
   biosorbents for removal of dyes from industrial effluent and also
   established the influence of other compounds present in the industrial

AB The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential use of
   biomass-based adsorbents, such as sugarcane bagasse, sawdust, and neem
   leaf, for the removal of malachite green from simulated and real
   effluent. The adsorbents prepared from bagasse are pretreated with
   formaldehyde, sulfuric acid, and phosphoric acid to improve the surface
   properties like porosity and surface area and its reflection on
   adsorption capacity. Neem leaf was used as an untreated adsorbent to
   compare the performance with that of treated adsorbents. The adsorption
   capacity of treated bagasse, sawdust, and untreated neem leaf adsorbent
   were compared with that of commercial powdered-activated carbon. The
   effect of initial dye concentration, adsorbent dosage and adsorbent
   surface modification on dye removal was examined for different contact
   time. It was observed that the adsorption efficiency of phosphoric
   acid-treated bagasse and neem leaf powder gives higher percentage of dye
   removal (97%) as compared to sulfuric acid- and formaldehyde-treated
   adsorbents (89% and 86%). Experiments performed on a real effluent using
   PSB as the adsorbent indicated a maximum color removal of 79% for an
   adsorbent dosage of 1 g/100 mL. Also equilibrium studies of the
   adsorption process were carried out and the adsorption data were fitted
   to Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models.

AB In this study, real wastewater from a dyeing factory and previously
   treated bybiological processes was decolorized by Fenton oxidation.
   Direct and reactive dyebaths and the related auxiliaries constituted the
   polluted effluents. A synthetic wastewater was also prepared in the same
   way in order to compare degradation performance. The study was performed
   with a systematic approach, searching optimum values of H2O2 and FeSO4
   concentrations, pH, temperature and the chemical structure of each
   tested dye. Depollution results showed that the oxidation behaviour of
   synthetic and real wastewaters was very similar, especially during the
   first stage where the breaking of chromophore groups allowed fast colour
   removal. However, it was found that higher ratios of [H2O2]/[FeSO4] must
   be engaged in the case of real wastewaters. Results also showed that the
   catalytic oxidation yielded a fast and complete depollution at
   [H2O2]/[FeSO4] = 70, pH 3( )and temperature 40 degrees C. For
   experiments with direct dye, colour and COD removals were, respectively,
   90% and 87% in the case of real wastewater. Reactive real wastewater
   showed non-stable oxidation evolution due to the hydrolysed dyestuff and
   this led to 83% and 45% decolourization and COD removal, respectively.
   Better depollution results were noted for the synthetic wastewater
   experiments. This finding was related to the non-stable composition of
   the real wastewater and the unknown chemical and physical interferences
   between its compounds. After sedimentation, reuse of the treated
   wastewater for new dyeing experiments was also investigated. For this
   purpose, the whole process was run under complete recycling mode and the
   previously treated effluent was re-used as fresh dyebath. Results in
   terms of colour depth and fastness showed that dyeing performances were
   very similar, and an important opportunity is offered by reusing
   wastewater treated by Fenton oxidation process.

AB Treatment of the textile effluent becomes complex due to the high color,
   organic load, dissolved solids content, and toxicity of the textile
   effluents. An optimized pre-ozonation treatment has been proposed, aimed
   at the maximum color and organics removal leading to possible resource
   recovery at the field-scale. The standalone ozonation at optimum
   conditions of pH, salinity, and dye concentration resulted in the color
   removal and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal of 96.13% and 67.40%,
   respectively, for synthetic textile effluent. The percentage removal of
   individual dyes from synthetic textile effluent was also analyzed. The
   standalone ozonation treatment of real textile effluent at optimum
   conditions resulted in 94.6% color removal and 67.4% COD removal. The
   pre-ozonation treatment followed by a sequential batch reactor proved
   effective in the removal of color (98.6%) and organic load (91.6%) of
   the real textile effluent. Pre-ozonation enhanced the biodegradability
   of the textile effluent, as observed by the 81.8% increase in
   biodegradability index and 126.2% increase in specific oxygen uptake
   rate. The proposed industrial textile effluent scheme, when applied to
   the industry producing 3500 kg fabric per day, presented a potential
   recovery of 157 m(3) effluent and 375 kg salt per day, which can result
   in the net annual saving of about INR 3.7 million, including additional
   treatment cost. The proposed treatment scheme significantly contributes
   to sustainable textile production.

   achieved under optimum operating conditions (pH=11; ozone flow rate:
   6x10(-3) m(3)/minute). Further the biodegradability index of the dye
   effluent has increased from an initial value of 0.18 to 0.49 during
   ozonation indicating favorable adaptation of ozonation as a primer to

AB The upflow anaerobic sludge blanket process followed by the biological
   aerated filter process was employed to improve the removal of color and
   recalcitrant compounds from real dyeing wastewater. The highest removal
   efficiency for color was observed in the anaerobic process, at 8-h
   hydraulic retention time, seeded with the sludge granule. In the
   subsequent aerobic process packed with the microbe-immobilized
   polyethylene glycol media, the removal efficiency for chemical oxygen
   demand increased significantly to 75 %, regardless of the empty bed
   contact time. The average influent non-biodegradable soluble chemical
   oxygen demand was 517 mg/L, and the average concentration in effluent
   from the anaerobic reactor was 363 mg/L, suggesting the removal of some
   recalcitrant matters together with the degradable ones. The average
   nonbiodegradable soluble chemical oxygen demand in effluent from the
   aerobic reactor was 87, 93, and 118 mg/L, with the removal efficiency of
   76, 74, and 67 %, at 24-, 12-, and 8-h empty bed contact time,
   respectively. The combined anaerobic sludge blanket and aerobic
   cell-entrapped process was effective to remove the refractory compounds
   from real dyeing wastewater as well as in reducing organic loading to
   meet the effluent discharge limits. This integrated process is
   considered an effective and economical treatment technology for dyeing
   wastewater.

AB Nanocatalysts such as ZnO, Fe and Fe/ZnO composite were synthesized for
   better treatment of dye than the conventional treatment methods. The
   catalysts were characterized using SEM, EDAX, BET surface area, XRD and
   DRS. The degradation of acid yellow 23 dye in aqueous solution has been
   investigated using sonolysis, photolysis and sonophotocatalysis. The
   effect of different conventional operating parameters such as initial
   solution pH, gas purging (Argon, Oxygen, Air and Nitrogen) and H2O2
   addition, under sonolysis (13 and 25 mm probe tip diameter) and
   photolysis (UV light), showed a maximum of 41 % colour removal for
   0.0187 mmol/L dye solution under photolysis with 88.2 mmol/L H2O2
   addition. Among the catalysts used, 98 % dye colour removal was obtained
   with 0.2 g/L Fe/ZnO composite under 60 min of sonophotolysis that had
   been benefitted by the synergistic effects. The HPLC spectrum of the
   untreated dye and treated dye supports the claim of eradication of the
   parent dye compound. Sonophotocatalytic treatment of real textile
   effluent in the presence of 6 g/L Fe/ZnO composite and 264.6 mmol/L H2O2
   reduced the COD level from 792 to 174.4 mg/L in 240 min to meet the
   allowable effluent discharge standard into running water streams. The
   studied treatment methods were found to be effective for the degradation
   of acid yellow 23 dye and subsequently in real textile effluent too.

   model. The mixture and the real textile effluent obtained lower removal,
   59 % and 48 %, respectively. The phytotoxicity tests using lettuce
   indicate the electrochemical reactions were effective to reduce the
   toxicity of almost all contaminated solutions, however, for more complex
   solution (mixture of dyes and real effluents), a longer reactional time
   is necessary. Also, chlorine species in the reaction medium can promote
   the germination due the oxidative which may help to break the seeds
   shells, nevertheless, such chemicals are harmful to the plant causing
   death before the growth. Therefore, the results pointed that the
   electrochemical reactions are efficient in solution discoloration and
   can be optimized to treat real textile effluents, indicating a reuse
   possibility for agricultural purpose.

AB A novel adsorbent prepared from the waste of Irvingia gabonensis nut
   (ADN) was used for scavenging of Cu2+ from aqueous solution. Various
   adsorption operational parameters were investigated in order to
   establish the behavior of ADN before further studies. The efficacy of
   ADN in concurrent removal of rhodamine B (RhB) dye and Cu2+ in a binary
   solution of RhB/Cu2+ was also investigated. Finally the potency of ADN
   in the treatment of real textile effluent was ascertained. Optimum
   adsorption of Cu2+ occurred at pH of 5.5 and high temperature favored
   Cu2+ removal. Pseudo second order kinetic best described the uptake of
   Cu2+ onto ADN. Maximum monolayer adsorption capacity was obtained to be
   103.09 mg/g. The Dubinin Radushkevich (D-R) isotherm as well as
   thermodynamic parameter suggests that adsorption of Cu2+ onto ADN was
   chemical in nature. Percentage removal of Cu2+ in single solution at
   optimum time was 94.70 % while synergistic effect of RhB moved this to
   99.54 % removal in the binary solution. ADN was highly efficient for the
   removal of dye and other organic pollutants in the real textile effluent
   with 100 % removal of some organic pollutant. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All

   achieved after 1 h using 424-1700 U ml(-1) of PPO, depending on dye.
   Optimum pH for decolorization process of all dyes was found to be 3.0.
   Potato PPO was capable of removing reactive dyes and textile dye
   effluents without requiring any mediator. Decolorization was
   accomplished via insoluble polymers formations that were separated by

   time for the effective removal of tri-dyes and chemical oxygen demand
   (COD) from the effluent. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the obtained

   in the order of 49.6%, 58.3%, 83.6%, for RR195, Blue222 and Y145,
   respectively. At the optimum levels of the factors, the colour removals
   were greater than 87% and the COD removal was found to be 85%.
   Afterwards, the electrical energy per order (EEO) was also determined.
   Therefore, the treatment was proved as an alternative purifier method

AB The use of readily available water treatment residuals (WTR) as a
   low-cost material for removal of colour from real textile wastewater was
   investigated. WTR was used in three forms, namely in raw wet form as a
   coagulant, in the dried form as an adsorbent and as a filtration media
   in column tests. The results showed a maximum colour removal of 55 and
   36% by coagulation and adsorption, respectively, and the corresponding
   COD removals were 35 and 37%. Coagulation and batch sorption tests
   showed the effect of initial pH on the colour removal, and maximum
   colour removal was obtained at an initial pH of 3.0. Long-duration
   continuous-flow column test using WTR as a filtration/sorption media
   showed that a maximum colour removal of 60% can be achieved. In column
   studies, complete exhaustion of the media occurred at 180 and 120 bed
   volumes, respectively, for initial pHs of 3.0 and 6.2. The study thus
   shows the potential of WTR for primary treatment of real textile dye
   wastewater.

AB Dye removal from the industrial effluents has become a significant
   problem in terms of both health and environmental considerations in the
   last decades. Dyes are toxic thus their removal from the industrial
   effluents is vital. In this study, poly(acrylamide) grafted onto
   cross-linked poly(4-vinyl pyridine) (P4-VP-g-PAm) was synthesised and
   used for the removal of anionic dye methyl orange (MO) and cationic dye
   methylene blue (MB) from the aqueous solutions. The factors influencing
   the sorption process was studied as a function of pH, sorbent dose,
   contact time and temperature. The sorption process was investigated in
   terms of Langmuir, Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherms and
   several sorption kinetic models were used to predict the nature of
   sorption. The novel sorbent worked efficiently in real sample analysis
   with acceptable accuracy and precision. As a result, P4-VP-g-PAm was
   found to be an efficient sorbent for the removal of MO and MB from
   aqueous solutions.

AB Reuse of alternative water sources is gaining impetus as an acceptable
   integrated water resources management practice due to the scarcity of
   freshwater resources, particularly in urban centres where population is
   dense and freshwater supply is limited. This study investigated on the
   practical application of titanium dioxide (TiO2) photocatalytic
   treatment technology as a standalone system for the removal of Reactive
   Black 5 (RB5) dye, which usually causes a serious aesthetic problem that
   depresses the wider social acceptance of greywater recycling and reuse
   schemes. An optimization study was conducted on the photocatalytic
   degradation of RB5 dye in synthetic greywater effluent (i.e. aqueous RB5
   in distilled water), in order to understand the effects of different
   photoreactor parameters on the degradation kinetics. It was found that
   the optimum photoreactor operating conditions are at TiO2 loading of 0.1
   g/L, pH 5, initial RB5 concentration of 1 ppm and without compressed air
   sparging. Results showed that a 97% removal of RB5 was evident after 150
   min of photocatalytic reaction in synthetic greyvvater effluent. With
   the established optimum photoreactor conditions, the photocatalytic
   degradation kinetics of RB5 dye in real greywater effluent was
   subsequently investigated. Results showed that the photocatalytic
   degradation of RB5 in real greywater effluent has a lower removal
   efficiency of 76% even after 330 min of reaction. It was hypothesized
   that the presence of other water pollutants in real greywater effluent
   could compete for the surface binding sites owing to the non-specific
   nature of TiO2 photocatalytic reaction. Thus, other greywater quality
   parameters such as oil and grease (O&G), chemical oxygen demand (COD),
   biological oxygen demand (BOD5), total nitrogen (TN) and total number of
   Escherichia coli were also monitored. Monitoring results showed that the
   parallel removal efficiencies of 60% O&G, 54% COD, 69% BOD5, 41% TN and
   100% E. coli were evident, which have proven the impact of water
   impurities in real greywater effluent that could lower the
   photocatalytic degradation efficiency of RB5. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB The present investigation deals with the treatment of different dye

   (corncobs, sugarcane bagasse, cotton sticks, sunflower and peanut husk).
   Samples of textile wastewater were collected from five different textile
   industries of Faisalabad, Pakistan. Screening test was conducted to
   select the biosorbent with maximum dye removal efficiency for each of
   textile wastewater samples. Different process parameters like biosorbent
   dose, shaking speed and temperature were optimized during the study. The
   biosorption process using corncobs biomass was found to be good for the
   removal of dyes up to 79% from the one real textile wastewater sample.
   The biosorption efficiency of adsorbents was maximum at 0.3 g 50 mL(-1)
   of adsorbent dose with 120 rpm shaking speed and 303 K temperature.
   Thermodynamic study was also carried out to evaluate different
   parameters like free energy change (Delta G degrees), enthalpy change
   (Delta H degrees) and entropy change (Delta S degrees) and biosorption
   process was found to be exothermic. Characterization of effluents was
   carried out before and after the biosorption process to check out the
   effect of process on the removal of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Total
   Dissolved Solids (TDS) and Total Suspended Solids (TSS). The results
   proved that agricultural wastes are good option for the removal of color
   and COD from real textile effluents.

AB One of the most polluting factors in the environment is the textile

   occurs in large volume. Moreover its effluents are in need of advanced
   treatment to be able to smoothly discharge to the receiving media. This
   study investigated the decolourisation efficiency of electrocoagulation
   process using three different electrodes, aluminum, zinc and iron, in
   Reactive Red 195 dye removal from model solutions. Effect of major
   operational parameters such as current density, pH, sacrificial
   electrode materials and operation time was followed for percentage
   decolourisation efficiency. The performance of the process was found to
   be maximum with iron electrode for Reactive Red 195 dye, but aluminum
   electrode was the best one for the real textile wastewater that is the
   mixture of textile dyes. Decolourisation efficiency reached to 98%
   employing current density of 40 mA cm(-2) and iron electrode for the
   real effluent containing the dye, and COD was eliminated 74% employing
   aluminum electrode at the same current density. As a conclusion
   electrocoagulation was found to be efficient in treating and
   decolorizing the textile effluents and model solutions.

   ultrasound-assisted modified corn straw (MCS). RCS and MCS were prepared
   and characterized in detail. The characterization indicated that RCS and
   MCS presented favorable structures for malachite green adsorption and
   that the ultrasound treatment provided a disorganization of the
   adsorbent's crystalline regions and also caused the formation of
   cavities and protuberances. The adsorption study was performed by
   equilibrium isotherms, kinetic curves, thermodynamic parameters, and
   application in real effluents composed of dye mixtures and inorganic
   compounds. The Elovich model was suitable for the adsorption kinetics
   and the Freundlich model was appropriate to represent the equilibrium.
   The maximum experimental adsorption capacities were 200 mg g(-1) for RCS
   and 210 mg g(-1) for MCS, obtained at 328 K. MCS was more effective than
   RCS to treat real effluents, attaining around 92% of color removal.

AB This paper studied the efficiency of electrocoagulation/electroflotation
   in removing colour from synthetic and real textile wastewater by using
   aluminium and iron electrodes in an external-loop airlift reactor of 20
   L. The disperse dye is a mixture of Yellow terasil 4G. Red terasil 343
   150% and Blue terasil 3R02, the reactive dye is a mixture of Red S3B
   195, Yellow SPD, Blue BRFS. For disperse dye, the removal efficiency was
   better using aluminium electrodes, whereas, the iron electrodes showed
   more efficiency for removing colour for reactive dye and mixed synthetic
   dye. Both for disperse, reactive and mixed dye. 40 mA cm(-2) and 20 min
   were respectively the optimal current density and electrolysis time. 7.5
   was an optimal initial pH for both reactive and mixed synthetic dye and
   6.2 was an optimal initial pH for disperse dye. The colour efficiency
   reached in general 90%. The results showed also that Red and Blue
   disappeared quickly comparatively to the Yellow component both for
   reactive and disperse dyes. The real textile wastewater was then used.
   Three effluents were also used: disperse, reactive and the mixture. The
   colour efficiency is between 70 and 90% and COD efficiency reached 78%.
   The specific electrical energy consumption per kg dye removed (E-dye) in
   optimal conditions for real effluent was calculated. 170 kWh/kg(dye) was
   required for a reactive dye, 120 kWh/kg(dye) for disperse and 50
   kWh/kg(dye) for the mixture. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The performance of Alginate - Cobalt ferrite (ACF) in a fixed bed column
   was assessed for the simultaneous removal of binary dyes from textile
   effluent. The binary dye effluent containing 32.5 mg/L of reactive red
   195 (RR195) and 21 mg/L of reactive yellow 145 (RY145) was used for the
   study. The effect of various parameters like bed depth (3, 6, 9 and 12
   cm) and flow rate of influent (5, 7.5 and 10 mL/min) for the binary
   adsorption using ACF was studied. The results revealed that ACF bed
   capacity and maximum adsorption capacity showed an increasing trend with
   an increased bed depth and decreased flow rate. Dynamic modeling such as
   Yoon - Nelson model, Thomas model and Bed Depth Service Time model
   (BDST) were evaluated with the experimental data. Comparatively, Yoon -
   Nelson and Thomas model presented better fitness for the elimination of
   RR195 and RY145 dye. The experimental data from dynamic studies revealed
   ACF's effectiveness for the sequestration of binary dyes from textile
   effluent.

AB The textile industry stands out as one of the largest consumers of water
   among the industrial sectors. Additionally, its effluent presents
   characteristics such as high load of chemical oxygen demand (COD), total
   organic carbon (TOC), suspended solids, color, turbidity, phenol, and
   salts, which require an efficient treatment of the wastewater produced.
   Among the several researches that have arisen focused on the treatment
   of textile effluents, electrocoagulation stands out. This method
   consists of an electrochemical process that generates its own coagulant
   by applying electric current to metal electrodes immersed in the
   solution. The electrodes used in the present study are metallic plates
   made of scrap iron. The objective of this work is to evaluate their
   application in an electrocoagulation process for the decolorization of
   real and synthetic effluents. The efficiency of the treatment was
   evaluated by applying it to a synthetic effluent containing commercial
   indigo blue dye and to a real effluent from the textile industry,
   assessing parameters such as color, turbidity, pH, electrical
   conductivity, COD, TOC, phenol, soluble iron, sludge generation, and
   electrode wear. The synthetic effluent obtained average color removal of
   95%, 96% phenol, and low sludge production in 120 min of electrolysis.
   In the real effluent from the textile industry, an average color removal
   of 92%, 97% turbidity, 100% phenol, 65% TOC, and 49% COD in 90 min of
   electrolysis was obtained. The electrocoagulation process using scrap
   iron as electrodes proved to be efficient in removing the dye present in
   the real textile industry effluent, as well as in the synthetic
   effluent.

AB In recent years, there has been increasing interest in developing green
   biocomposite for industrial wastewater treatment. In this study,
   prawn-shell-derived chitosan (CHT) and kaolinite rich modified clay (MC)
   were used to fabricate biocomposite beads with different compositions.
   Prepared composite beads were characterized by FTIR, and XRD, and SEM.
   The possible application of the beads was evaluated primarily by
   measuring the adsorption efficiency in standard models of lead (II) and
   methylene blue (MB) dye solution, and the results show a promising
   removal efficiency. In addition, the composites were used to remove Cr
   (VI), Pb (II), and MB from real industrial effluents. From tannery
   effluent, 50.90% of chromium and 39.50% of lead ions were removed by
   composites rich in chitosan and 31.50% of MB was removed from textile
   effluent by a composite rich in clay. Moreover, the composite beads were
   found to be activated in both acidic and basic media depending on their
   composition, which gives a scope to their universal application in dye
   and heavy metal removal from wastewater from various industries.

AB Ordered nanoporous silica SBA-15 was successfully synthesized and
   functionalized by tris(2-aminoethyl)amine (Tren), a multi-amine ligand,
   to develop efficient cationic dye adsorbent. The prepared materials were
   characterized by XRD, N-2 adsorption-desorption, TGA, and FT-IR
   analysis. Tren-SBA-15 was used for the removal of malachite green (MG)
   from both aqueous solution and real textile effluent. The effects of
   various operational parameters including solution pH, adsorbent dosage,
   contact time, initial concentration and temperature on removal of MG
   using Tren-SBA-15 were investigated in batch adsorption mode. Within the
   optimum conditions, Tren-SBA-15 exhibited an excellent adsorptive
   capability of 2330 m g(-1) (6.38 mmol g(-1)) with removal of 89.8%.
   Equilibrium data was best described by the Freundlich and Sips isotherm
   models indicated a favorable adsorption process (n(F) > 1) and
   heterogeneous system for dye adsorption (n(S) > 1). The adsorption
   kinetic behavior was influenced by intraparticle diffusion and
   pseudo-second-order kinetic model provided well-fitted to the
   experimental data. The kinetic rate constant increased with temperature.
   Qualitative estimates of the thermodynamic parameters showed that the
   overall adsorption process is spontaneous (G < 0) and a bit endothermic
   (H > 0), and adsorption mechanism was assumed to be a physisorption.
   Experiment with real textile wastewater showed 48.7% MG removal by the
   use of 0.01 g Tren-SBA-15. The reusability of the adsorbent in real
   wastewater was shown to be successful along with its regeneration
   possibility. Desorption experiments were performed by two deferent
   eluents to desorbs both cationic ions and dye molecules from
   Tren-SBA-15. The results showed that dye is removed completely from real
   effluent after two continues adsorption/desorption cycles. (c) 2014

AB The textile industry has experienced significant advances accompanied by
   the production of large volumes of polluted water released into the
   environment, which requires treatment that varies according to the
   nature of the pollutants. The present work aimed at testing 13X type
   zeolites synthesized from Djebel Debagh DD1, DD2, and DD3 kaolins in
   order to remove dyes and other pollutants from the effluent of the
   COTITEX textile industry (Batna, Algeria). Several experimental
   parameters were studied (pH, temperature, initial concentration, mass of
   adsorbent) and physicochemical characterization was carried out on the
   synthesized adsorbents and the effluent to be treated. The 13X zeolites
   synthesized from DD1, DD2, and DD3 kaolins were characterized using
   X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy,
   and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Adsorption experiments were
   performed using the anionic dye present in the effluent and using real
   textile effluent. The results showed that the dye adsorption is
   efficient and feasible at ambient temperature on the 13X zeolite
   synthesized from DD1 kaolin compared with 13X zeolites synthesized from
   DD2 and DD3, with good color removal efficiency. Experiments with real
   textile wastewater showed a significant improvement in the
   physicochemical characteristics (COD, BOD5, TSS, PO43-, and NO2-)
   compared with the untreated effluent.

AB Textile dyeing industrial wastewater needs simplified and efficient
   treatment method for dye removal. Coagulation is a technique among
   several treatment techniques available for the removal of color in the
   textile effluent. In coagulation process, inorganic metal salts such as
   alum, ferric chloride, and synthetic polymers are generally used as a
   coagulant. Because of the drawbacks involved in metal salts, more
   research is motivated on natural biopolymeric materials. In this study,
   an efficient novel biopolymeric coagulant alginate, which is extracted
   from the Sargassum sp., a marine brown alga from the coastal region of
   Gulf of Mannar, is used for the removal of Reactive Magenta dye in the
   real-time textile industrial wastewater. The Reactive Magenta dye
   present in the wastewater is treated using the conventional jar test
   with alginate as a coagulant. The raw alginate and dye loaded alginate
   was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and
   scanning electron microscopy techniques. The effect of alginate dose,
   calcium dose, and settling time was investigated. It was observed that
   the maximum color removal of 92.7% at optimum conditions of 30 mg/L of
   alginate dose, 4 g/L of calcium dose, and in a neutral pH was achieved.
   Based on this study, it has been validated that the alginate, a natural
   biopolymeric compound extracted from brown algae Sargassum sp., can be
   used an effective coagulant for Reactive Magenta dye removal from the
   real-time textile wastewater.

AB Textile industries are responsible for one of the major environmental
   pollution problems in the world, because they release undesirable dye
   effluents. Textile wastewater contains dyes mixed with various
   contaminants at a variety of ranges. Therefore, environmental
   legislation commonly obligates textile factories to treat these
   effluents before discharge into the receiving watercourses. The
   treatment efficiency of any pilot-scale study can be examined by feeding
   the system either with real textile effluents or with artificial
   wastewater having characteristics, which match typical textile factory
   discharges. This paper presents a critical review of the currently
   available literature regarding typical and real characteristics of the
   textile effluents, and also constituents including chemicals used for
   preparing simulated textile wastewater containing dye, as well as the
   treatments applied for treating the prepared effluents. This review
   collects the scattered information relating to artificial textile
   wastewater constituents and organises it to help researchers who are
   required to prepare synthetic wastewater. These ingredients are also
   evaluated based on the typical characteristics of textile wastewater,
   and special constituents to simulate these characteristics are
   recommended. The processes carried out during textile manufacturing and
   the chemicals corresponding to each process are also discussed.

   exhibited high stability in water and when subjected to external
   pressure between 0.1 and 1.5 GPa. The highly stable MIL53 (Al)150DMF was
   employed for adsorptive removal of cationic, anionic, and mixed dye
   solutions. The adsorption capacities were 296.3 and 277 mg/g of
   individual cationic and anionic dyes, respectively. The material
   exhibited a remarkable capacity for the adsorptive removal of a highly
   complex mixed dye solution containing three cationic and three anionic
   dyes. A regeneration study depicted a reuse of the material without
   significant loss in the adsorption capacity. Further, the material was
   successfully tested for the adsorption of dye from a dye industry

   experiments were conducted according to the Box-Behnken experimental

   determined by the Minitab 14 program. The optimum variables were found
   to be 10 g/ L biomass concentration for biomasses, 3 for initial pH of
   the solution, and 20 A degrees C for temperature with an observed dye
   removal efficiency of about 60 and 80 % with L. 12 and L. rhamnosus
   biomasses, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy and Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy images also showed that the biomass
   characteristics studied were favored by the sorption of the dye from the
   textile industry wastewater. Consequently, these biomasses may be
   considered as good biosorbents due to their effective yields and the

AB The experimental results performed after the application of one
   single-stage treatment by sorption onto coal fly ash are evaluated in
   order to decolorize a real textile effluent of a private company
   specializing in manufacturing of cotton fabrics (i.e., sorption
   performance applied for a real textile effluent collected after the
   fabric dyeing, rinsing, and final finishing steps). The experiments are
   focused on studying the effect of initial textile effluent pH, adsorbent
   dose, temperature and adsorption time, considered as operating
   parameters of sorption process for high pollutant removals (e.g.,
   organic pollutants as dyes, phenols, polymeric, and degradation
   compounds), and decoloration. The results indicate high values of
   decoloration degree (55.42-83.00 %) and COD removal (44.44-61.11 %) when
   it is worked at <= 2 with coal ash dose of 12-40 g/L, temperature higher
   than 20-25 degrees C, and continuous static operating regime (with an
   initial agitation step of 3-5 min). The treated textile effluent
   fulfills the quality demand, and is recyclable, inside reused or
   discharged after a stage of neutralization (standard pH of 6.5-8.5 for
   all textile effluent discharges). Also, the final effluent is able to
   follow the common path to the central biological treatment plant (i.e.,
   a centralized treatment plant for all companies acting in the industrial
   site area with mechanical-biological steps for wastewater treatment) or
   may be directly discharged in the nearly watercourse.

AB The aim of this study is to develop a simple, economical and effective
   treatment scheme to treat effluents from small scale textile dyeing
   units and tanneries, which have been set up in rural areas. The
   physicochemical properties of real time effluents procured from these
   industries were analysed. The workflow required for treating these
   effluents were ascertained by preliminary tests carried out on
   synthetically created solutions. A novel treatment scheme for tannery
   and textile dye effluents sludge volume reduction by the use of sodium
   hypochlorite was identified. Effective methods for the safe disposal and
   recycling of all the by-products generated from different steps were
   discussed. The proposed scheme was successfully able to decolourize and
   detoxify both the tannery and textile dyeing effluent with over 90%
   removal of both COD and BOD. The impacts of the treatment scheme on 14
   different effluent parameters were reported. The methodology developed
   in this study may be utilized to construct simple localized treatment
   units for handling effluents in isolated rural areas. This preliminary
   treatment at the source, will help in the reduction of the load on the
   local treatment plants and prevent their choking.

   inter-electrode distance of 3 cm. Robustness of the process was
   investigated on real and anaerobically pre-treated textile wastewater.
   For real textile effluents, the process produced approximately 99%
   colour removal efficiency, creating virtually colourless solution even
   at a lesser reaction time of 60 min. Electrocoagulation effectively
   detoxified the anaerobically pre-treated textile wastewater by
   eliminating 78% of aromatic amines within a reaction time of 180 min.

   the Hummer method. The product is characterized by various techniques
   such as scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared, X-ray
   diffraction, and UV-vis spectroscopy. The prepared GO is used as a novel
   absorbent to remove different dyes, organic, and inorganic pollutants
   from real textile wastewater. The effects of operational parameters like
   absorbent dosage (13-25 mg), pH (3-9), and contact time (12-30 min) on
   wastewater treatment are studied by response surface methodology. The
   optimized parameters are found to be 25 mg for GO dosage, pH 8, and 25
   min for contact time. The chemical oxygen demand removal efficiency is
   calculated 62.10% under optimum conditions. These results suggest that
   the GO nanoparticles are a good candidate for the rapid remove of dyes
   and complicated pollutants from aqueous solutions.

   color from synthetic and real textile wastewater. Two representative dye
   molecules were selected for the synthetic dye wastewater: a blue
   reactive dye (Reactive Blue 140) and a disperse dye (Disperse Red 1).
   The electrochemical technique showed satisfactory color removal
   efficiency and reliable performance in treating both individual and
   mixed dye types. The removal efficiency and energy consumption data
   showed that, for a given current density, iron was superior to aluminum
   in treating both the reactive dye and the disperse dye. With an initial
   dye concentration of 100 mg L-1, the energy cost in achieving >95% color
   removal was on the order of I kWh m(-3) for both dyes. The effect of
   changing the initial pH of the samples on the removal efficiency and
   energy consumption was also studied. It was found that the design
   parameters used for the synthetic wastewater were less effective for
   treatment of real textile wastewater, with 1 in 5 tests on real
   wastewater failing. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   consisted of 45 degrees pitched iron paddle anode and a horizontal iron

   performance of the vessel was expressed in terms of the percentage of
   color removal and power consumption calculations. Different parameters
   have been studied such as: electrolysis time, current density, NaCl
   concentration, initial dye concentration, initial solution pH, mixing
   speed (rpm), distance between electrodes, and different anode/cathode
   combinations. Results revealed that at optimum operating conditions
   using Fe/Fe electrode combination almost complete color removal of the
   two investigated dyes has been achieved. Economic studies reveal that
   removal of one kg of the reactive and direct dye requires 1.87 and 1.5
   EGP, respectively. The treatment of real textile effluent at the optimum
   conditions using the present batch agitated vessel achieved 95.45% color

AB A microbial consortium that is able to grow in wheat bran (WB) medium
   and decolorize the carcinogenic azo dye Congo red (CR) was developed.
   The microbial consortium was immobilized on polyurethane foam (PUF).
   Batch studies with the PUF-immobilized microbial consortium showed
   complete removal of CR dye (100 mgL(-1)) within 12 h at pH 7.5 and
   temperature 30 +/- 0.2 degrees C under microaerophilic conditions.
   Additionally, 92% American Dye Manufactureing Institute (ADMI) removal
   for real textile effluent (RTE, 50%) was also observed within 20 h under
   the same conditions. An upflow column reactor containing PUF-immobilized
   microbial consortium achieved 99% CR dye (100 mgL(-1)) and 92% ADMI
   removal of RTE (50%) at 35 and 20 mLh(-l) flow rates, respectively.
   Consequent reduction in TOC (83 and 79%), COD (85 and 83%) and BOD (79
   and 78%) of CR dye and RTE were also observed, which suggested
   mineralization. The decolorization process was traced to be enzymatic as
   treated samples showed significant induction of oxidoreductive enzymes.
   The proposed biodegradation pathway of the dye revealed the formation of
   lower molecular weight compounds. Toxicity studies with a plant bioassay
   and acute tests indicated that the PUF-immobilized microbial consortium
   favors detoxification of the dye and textile effluents.

AB Various agricultural residues have been tested as biosorbents due to
   their low cost, high surface area, and favorable surface chemistry. In
   this work, a sweet orange albedo was tested as a biosorbent for
   treatment of real textile effluents. The orange albedo powder was
   prepared by drying the residue at 50 degrees C and milling to 30 mesh,
   and then used for dye adsorption from a alkaline (pH = 10.71) effluent.
   The adsorption process was studied in batch experiments at 30 degrees C
   by measuring color removal and chemical oxygen demand (COD). The color
   removal was found not to be significantly altered when the effluent was
   used in its raw state, while COD increased probably due to albedo
   degradation. For the effluent diluted to 60% (V-effluent VH2O-1), color
   and COD removal percentages of approximately 89% were obtained. It was
   found that pH played a very significant role on the adsorption process,
   as the treated albedo displayed a relative pH(PZC)star of 4.61, and the
   highest dye removal efficiencies were reached at pH lower than 2. The
   COD was strongly influenced by the effluent dilution. The effectiveness
   in eliminating color and COD shows that orange albedo can be potentially
   used as a biosorbent to treat textile wastewater.

   In this work, real effluents that contained indigo dye were treated by
   means of 4 different ultrafiltration membranes. The feasibility to
   recover the concentrated dye with lab and semi-industrial pilots was
   also investigated. The studied membranes achieved up to 99% colour
   removal and 80% chemical oxygen demand (COD) decrease. Finally, the
   concentrates containing 20 g L-1 of indigo dye were reused in new dyeing
   processes. Colour differences (DECMC) and rubbing and washing fastnesses
   were evaluated. Fabrics dyed with the recovered indigo concentrates
   exhibited similar characteristics than the ones obtained with the

   solution and a real effluent (Brazilian textile industry) were treated.
   The photocatalytic degradation was carried out over three hours in a

   for the degradation of methyl orange dye and real textile effluent.
   Studies were performed with variation in parameters such as oxidant
   (sodium persulfate), commercially available zinc oxide, methyl orange
   concentration, and sonochemically synthesised zinc oxide. Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy,
   energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction analysis of
   synthesised zinc oxide showed that the particle size was in the nano
   range. Near-complete colour removal by sonophotocatalytic treatment was
   observed for a concentration of 10mgl(-1) of methyl orange with 1gl(-1)
   of synthesised zinc oxide and 1500mgl(-1) of sodium persulfate. For
   100mgl(-1) of methyl orange, the colour removal was 77% for 1gl(-1)
   commercially available zinc oxide and 84% for 1gl(-1) synthesised zinc
   oxide respectively, with 1500mgl(-1) sodium persulfate. Similar
   experimental conditions were applied for the sonophotocatalytic
   treatment of real textile effluent with different dilutions (1:100,
   1:10, and 1:1) and raw effluent. For real textile effluent,
   sonophotocatalytic treatment was found to be highly effective both in

AB Fabric dyeing produces high amounts of wastewater containing organic and
   inorganic pollutants such as reactive dyes that are the most common
   textile dyes employed by the industry. Three vinylsulfonic reactive
   dyes, blue 19 (B-19), red 198 (R-198), and yellow 15 (Y-15), were
   removed from effluents of industrial-like dyeing processes employing
   three adsorbents: (1) magnetite nanoparticles (MNP), (2) yeast waste
   obtained after beta-glucan removal from yeast biomass (YW), and (3)
   nanomagnetic composite produced from YW and MNP (YW-MNP). The non-linear
   kinetic pseudo-second-order and two-stage models best explained the
   experimental phenomena for the majority of adsorbate:adsorbent systems.
   The theoretical isotherm models were fitted to experimental isotherms
   obtained from experiments conducted with appropriated dilutions of
   effluents, which have a specific condition, limited by the maximum dye
   concentration established by the dye recipe. Thus, the saturation of
   adsorbents was not reached for all adsorbate:adsorbent systems. In this
   way, the best conditional sorption capacities (SCcond) were obtained by
   YW (1.7, 2.3, and 2.5 g/kg for B-19, R-198, and Y-15, respectively). The
   SIPS model best described all dyes adsorbed by YW, while the D-R model
   best described the phenomena for MNP and YW-MNP.

AB Color-producing chemicals emitted from many sources, such as textile or
   dye manufacturing industries, are a significant concern worldwide. The
   present study focuses on the electro-peroxone (EP) process for
   decolorizing a synthetic azo dye, C.I. Reactive Black 5 (RB5). Findings
   suggest that the EP process is more effective for dye degradation than
   ozonation and electrolysis. The EP process resulted in 100%
   decolorization after 60 min of contact time under optimum testing
   conditions such as pH 7, applied current 300 mA, and sulfate
   concentration 3.55 g L-1. Based on the findings of the primary
   investigation, EP treatment of real textile effluent was carried out and
   2 h of EP treatment resulted in 99% decolorization and 74%total organic
   carbon (TOC) removal. As an outcome, the EP process can treat textile
   wastewater in a cost-effective and environmentally friendly manner.

AB The current study explicates the feasibility of using dolochar, a solid
   waste generated from the sponge iron industry, for removal of color from
   synthetic textile dye solution containing equal amounts of the dyes
   Reactive Red 120 (RR 120) and Disperse Blue 3 (DB 3). The study
   investigated the significance of major experimental process parameters
   on adsorption. The experimental data were well fitted to the Langmuir
   isotherm model (R-2= 0.99) with a maximum adsorption capacity of 39.71
   mg g(-1). The adsorption kinetics were properly explained by a
   pseudo-second-order reaction (R-2= 0.99). The values of the separation
   factor 0.109 (1 >R-L> 0), Freundlich exponent 3.108(n> 1), and
   thermodynamic parameters (Delta G, -4,371 kJ mol(-l)at 303 degrees K and
   Delta H, 6,124 kJ mol(-1)) pointed to favorable, spontaneous, and
   endothermic adsorption processes, respectively. Treatment of real
   dye-bath water with dolochar resulted in 94.4% dye removal efficiency.
   The viability of using dolochar as a potential adsorbent for dye removal
   from textile industry effluent is established in this study. (c) 2020

   baffled reactor (ABR)-hybrid coagulation/membrane bioreactor (HCMBR) for
   real textile dyeing wastewater treatment. It was found that the target
   compounds except for the chrysene, benzo(b)fluoranthene,
   dibenzo(a,h)anthracene, and benzo(g,hi)perylene occurred widely in raw
   textile dyeing wastewater, treated effluent and sludge samples. In the
   raw wastewater, two-ring naphthalene was the dominant compound, while
   three-ring PAHs predominated in the final effluent. The dominant
   compounds in the raw sludge samples were phenanthrene, while they were
   pyrene and indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene for final discharge sludge. The
   combination process achieved over 88% removal for all the PAHs. Low
   molecular weight (LMW) PAHs might be mainly removed by volatilization,
   adsorption, and sedimentation in the ABR treatment unit. High molecular
   weight (HMW) PAHs might be mainly removed by adsorption and
   sedimentation processes after coagulation and solid-liquid separation in
   the HCMBR treatment unit. The final discharge of treated textile dyeing
   wastewater and sludge was biologically safe based on the toxicity
   evaluation test.

   results indicated smooth surface morphology before and after adsorption.
   XRD results further confirmed the proper crosslinking of silk nanofibres

   nanofibres showed a great potential in the removal of acid blue 117 from
   aqueous medium, i.e., 98% adsorption within a 1-min interaction time.
   FTIR results also confirmed that multiple interactions between the dye
   and substrate caused the fast adsorption of acid dyes. Therefore, the

AB Abstract The main goal of this research was to study the adsorptive
   capacity of an organophilic clay for the removal of textile dye Nylosan
   blue B113 and its further application in real textile effluent (RTE)
   treatment. The used clay known as Bofe was originated in the township of
   Boa Vista, State of Paraíba, Northeast of Brazil. Initially, the
   material was dried and powdered. Subsequently, the organophilic clay was
   synthesized by insertion of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide.
   Furthermore, the clay was characterized using the following analyses:
   cation exchange capacity (CEC), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), surface area
   analysis, and pH of point of zero charge (pHpzc). Then, batch adsorption
   systems were performed along with equilibrium/kinetic/thermodynamic
   studies. At last, keeping the same weight/volume ratio, a solution of
   real textile effluent was treated. Results showed CEC of 54.40
   mmol/100g, lamellar expansion from 1.69 to 2.01 nm, maximum adsorptive
   capacity of 50 mg.g-1, and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal of 74%
   (RTE).

AB An upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB)-submerged aerated biofilter
   (SAB) system was evaluated to remove color and chemical oxygen demand
   (COD) from real textile effluent. The system was operated for 335 days
   in three phases (P-1, P-2, P-3) with total hydraulic retention time
   varying from 21 h to 14 h. The results showed that high sulfate levels
   (>300 mg SO42-/L) impaired the dye reduction. The best color removal
   efficiencies of 30% and 96% for the UASB and the reactor system,
   respectively, were obtained in P-1; the SAB higher efficiency was
   associated with adsorption. The best COD removal efficiency of 71% for
   the reactor system was obtained in P-2. Precipitation of some material
   composed mostly of sulfur (98%) and some metals occurred in the UASB.
   However, the precipitated sulfur was again oxidized in the SAB. The
   system also showed an effective toxicity reduction in tests (Daphnia
   magna) with the treated effluent. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Textile dye wastewaters are characterized by strong colour, salts and
   other additives, high pH, temperature, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and
   biodegradable materials. Being aesthetically and environmentally
   unacceptable, these wastewaters need to be treated before their
   discharge. Anaerobic bioprocesses have been proposed as being
   environmentally friendly and relatively cheap; however, when applied to
   real effluent with a complex composition, they can fail. In this study,
   a photoreactor combining UV light and TiO2, immobilized in cellulosic
   fabric, was applied for the treatment of two industrial textile
   wastewaters. High colour and COD removal, and detoxification, were
   achieved for both wastewaters, at controlled pH of 5.5. Effluents showed
   very poor biodegradability due to their complex composition; thus, the
   proposed process is an efficient alternative.

AB In this study, the decolorization of industrial textile wastewaters was
   studied in batch mode using spent "Greek coffee" grounds (COF) as
   low-cost adsorbents. In this attempt, there is a cost-saving potential
   given that there was no further modification of COF (just washed with
   distilled water to remove dirt and color, then dried in an oven).
   Furthermore, tests were realized both in synthetic and real textile
   wastewaters for comparative reasons. The optimum pH of adsorption was
   acidic (pH = 2) for synthetic effluents, while experiments in free pH
   (non-adjusted) were carried out for real effluents. Equilibrium data
   were fitted to the Langmuir, Freundlich and Langmuir-Freundlich (L-F)
   models. The calculated maximum adsorption capacities (Q(max)) for total
   dye (reactive) removal at 25 degrees C was 241 mg/g (pH = 2) and 179
   mg/g (pH = 10). Thermodynamic parameters were also calculated (Delta
   H-0, Delta G(0), Delta S-0). Kinetic data were fitted to the
   pseudo-first, -second and -third order model. The optimum pH for
   desorption was determined, in line with desorption and reuse analysis.
   Experiments dealing the increase of mass of adsorbent showed a strong
   increase in total dye removal.

AB The rapid removal of dye effluent containing two or more dyes is in
   demand due to its significant environmental issues. The present
   communication deals with the simultaneous adsorption of Reactive red 195
   (RR195) and Reactive yellow 145 (RY145) from a textile dye effluent in a
   binary component system. Cobalt ferrite-alginate nanocomposite
   synthesized by ex-situ polymerization was employed as an adsorbent for
   the removal of binary dye effluent. The first order derivative
   spectrophotometric method was applied for the simultaneous
   quantification of RR195 and RY145 in binary solutions. The binary
   adsorption equilibrium could be achieved within 60 min, and the
   adsorption process followed pseudo second order kinetics. The removal
   efficiency could be maintained in a wide pH range of 3-6. The presence
   of amine, hydroxyl, carbonate and ferrite groups on the adsorbent
   surface played a vital role in the removal of RR195 and RY145 from their
   binary mixture. The continuous adsorption experiments revealed that the
   breakthrough time and exhaustion time increases with an increase in the
   bed height. The experimental results present new sustainable, cost
   effective biocompatible nanocomposite as a potential adsorbent for the
   removal of real-time dye effluent. Moreover, it is magnetically
   separable and reusable. The cobalt ferrite-alginate as a sole
   nanocomposite is capable of eliminating the whole dye content from a
   mixture and serves as a better solution for effective water remediation.

AB Textile industries are one of the leading environmental pollutants by
   releasing harmful dye effluents. In many textile distrts, the amount of
   excess color in treated textile effluent that exceeds regulatory
   limitations is still being a major concern. The combining usage of
   nanomaterials and polymer material to solve these issues using various
   techniques. In this research, graphene oxide-copper oxide (GO-CuO)
   nanomaterial have been incorporated into cellulose-acetate (CA),
   poly-ether sulfone (PES) blend polymer by using phase inversion process
   to fabricate thin film nanocomposite (TFN) membrane for removal of dye
   pollutant. The physiochemical properties of prepared TFN materials were
   studied by Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray
   diffractometer (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy
   (FE-SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), thermo gravimetric analysis
   (TGA), and mechanical strength analysis. Dye adsorption experiments were
   performed with four typical water-soluble organic dyes methylene blue
   (MB), rhodamine blue (Rh. B), methyl orange (MO) and Congo red (CR).
   After reaching adsorption equilibrium, the composite membrane final
   removal effectiveness for MB 92.42%, Rh. B 89.39%, CR 68.39%, and MO
   58.82% respectively. As a result, the fabricated TFN material proves to
   be an effective adsorbent material for cationic dye molecules. Also,
   when the fabricated material was tested with textile industry effluent
   sample, all physio-chemical properties exhibited a considerable decrease
   in concentrations when compared to the real textile effluent
   concentration. The treated effluents permitted for a relatively greater
   growth and germination index of Tropical amaranth roots than the textile
   effluent, this demonstrates that phytotoxicity testing was also
   successful. The most effective temperature, concentration and pH were
   found to be 273 K, 1 x 10(-5) M and pH 9. The fabricated TFN membrane
   material (GO-CuO@CA-PES) can be recommended for water treatment
   applications.

AB In this study, the removal of dyes, sulfide, and some other components
   in batik wastewater using a nanofiltration (NF) membrane was
   investigated. Remazol red (RR dye), indigosol brown (IB dye), and sodium
   sulfide (Na2S) were used as models of synthetic batik wastewater.
   Furthermore, NF performance for treating real batik wastewater was also
   examined. The effects of operating conditions on flux and rejection were
   investigated. The results showed that all filtration had similar
   permeate flux behavior, where rapid flux decline was observed at the
   initial filtration, followed by gradual flux decrease and then reaching
   a stable flux. The rejections of the pollutant model during NF of
   synthetic wastewater were 61-76%, 90-95%, and 90-99% for sulfide, IB,
   and RR, respectively. The color rejection in real batik wastewater was
   99.84%. Further, the removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) reached
   87.6%.

AB Color removal was evaluated in anaerobic assays using synthetic (SE) and
   real (RE) effluents containing the dye Direct Black 22 (DB22). The focus
   was on the individual influence of two electron donors (EDs), sucrose
   and ethanol; and their combination with two redox mediators (RMs),
   lawsone and riboflavin. In addition to SE assays, the EDs were combined
   with sulfate which was present in the RE. Distinct behavior was observed
   with both assays. In the case of SE, using the EDs sucrose and ethanol
   resulted in DB22 removal efficiency of 93 and 83%, respectively; but
   only 27% in the control. The respective removal rates were 27.8- and
   4.4-fold higher than that of the control. Using the EDs with the RM
   lawsone resulted in color removal higher than that with riboflavin.
   Interestingly, in the ethanol+sulfate assay, late release of the last
   was observed, possibly due to the desulfonation reaction of the aromatic
   structures during the DB22 molecule breakdown. In the case of RE, no
   improvement was observed with either EDs; and some combinations with the
   RMs even resulted in decreased color removal. Therefore, the used EDs
   and RMs showed positive effect on color removal in SEs; but unexpectedly
   not in REs.

AB In this research, the ability of preformed aerobic granules, which were

   real dyeing wastewater. The percentages of real dyeing wastewater in the
   influent were increased gradually from 50% to 100% in orders to
   investigate the ability of granules in treating of real dyeing
   wastewater. According to outcomes, maximum chemical oxygen demand (COD)
   elimination was up to 87%, while the best percentage of dye removal was
   about 42.6%. Due to the toxic effect of dyeing wastewater, 43.3%
   reduction in the amount of specific oxygen uptake rate (SOUR) was
   observed after 90 day of operation. Furthermore, when the percentages of
   real dyeing wastewater increased to 100%, the granules collapsed, which
   lead to decrement of granular ratio (GR). Granules collapsing led to
   86.5%, 49.73% and 40% reduction in GR(0.3), GR(0.5 )and GR(1),
   respectively.

   then treatment of a real textile wastewater. Effective operational
   parameters including pH and coagulant and photocatalyst dosage were
   studied in synthetic wastewater and then the process was applied for
   real wastewater. Both coagulation and photocatalytic processes were pH
   dependent. At coagulant dosage of 200 mg/L and initial pH of 6, the dye
   concentration decreased from 200 to 31 mg/L. Complete removal of AR73
   was observed with MgO nanoparticles of 0.8 g/L, initial pH of 5 and
   reaction time of 60 min. Langmuir-Hinshelwood model was well fitted with
   removal results (R-2: 0.939-0.988 for different initial dye
   concentration). In the case of real textile wastewater, the sequence
   coagulation-UVA/MgO nanoparticles photocatalytic degradation yielded

AB A substantial variation in characteristics arises from the use of
   dye-house wastewater. Such a dye-house effluent is heavily polluted and
   has to be treated before discharge and/or reuse. The pre-treatment is
   needed in order to avoid high operational costs as a consequence of
   frequent membrane fouling. Therefore, the aim of this research was to
   study the appropriateness of dead-end ultrafiltration (UF), with or
   without a flocculation pre-treatment, with the emphasis on colour and
   chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal. The dyes employed in the dyeing
   processes were disperse dyes for polyester fabrics, as well as
   metal-complex dyes for the dyeing of polyamide fabrics. The removal
   efficiencies for colour and COD were studied using several
   ultrafiltration membranes. Two hydrophobic and one hydrophilic
   commercial UF membranes were selected. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   dissolved solids (TDS) were obtained. The practical applicability of
   NF270 membrane for real handdrawn batik wastewater treatment fulfilled
   the quality standards in terms of TSS, COD, and BOD parameters. Overall,
   the NF270 membrane showed favorable performance for batik effluent

AB Highly efficient low-cost alum sludge-based sorbents, (termed as
   AS-Sorbents), derived from alum sludge by-product waste have shown a
   significant potential for treating wastewaters contaminated by textile
   dyes. Their application for wastewater treatment can be termed as
   industrial ecology approach. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron
   microscope were used to investigate the structural and morphological
   properties of these sorbents (AS, AS400, AS600, AS800). The results
   revealed the presence of the highly efficient adsorbent, zeolite in
   AS400. The experimental data revealed that AS-Sorbents exhibited a
   reasonable textile dye removal from real jeans dying effluent. The
   highest removal rate was corresponding to AS400 due to the presence of
   graphite and zeolite. Compared to the commercially available silica gel
   (Sgel) and activated carbon (Norit), AS-Sorbents are exhibited a
   superior removal rate of Procion Blue dye from textile effluent. The
   adsorption efficiency is in the order of AS400 >> AS > AS600 > AS800 >
   Norit > Sgel. The adsorption matrix was well fitted by Langmuir isotherm
   and followed second-order kinetic model; the maximum monolayer
   adsorption capacity was 6.5 mg/g. Thermodynamic parameters show that the
   process follows the physical adsorption matrix with a spontaneous and
   exothermic nature.

AB Treatment of dye-containing effluents is a significant challenge because
   dyes are toxic and pose a threat to the environment. Recent studies have
   shown that natural clay is able to efficiently remove colour from
   effluents that contain dyes and various additives. The objective of this
   study is to investigate the combined effects of dyes, salts and
   auxiliary chemicals used in the dyeing process, on the adsorption
   process onto natural clay for the treatment of dye-containing effluents.
   Batch adsorption experiments were performed using real and synthetic
   effluents containing dyes (Reactive Red 120, Reactive Orange 84 and
   Reactive Blue 160), and natural clays (Fouchana and Tabarka). The
   results show that both of the natural clays are efficient in treating
   real effluents. Fouchana clay shows a higher efficiency than Tabarka
   clay in the discolouration of the most colour loaded solution. The added
   chemical of enzymatic nature (Catalase) facilitates the adsorption of
   anionic dyes onto clay, likely by electrostatic attraction interaction
   with the SOS groups in the dye, followed by the adsorption onto the
   clays, of the dye-enzyme system. The mixture of all additives, enhances
   the adsorption of dyes on the clays, and does not act as a barrier to
   the decolouration process. Therefore, clays which are inexpensive and
   effective adsorbents may be promising alternatives for the treatment of
   the textile dyeing effluents. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   PersiManXyn1 was proficiently applied for dye removal from water using
   two strategies. While only pristine nano-carrier and free enzyme showed
   no considerable catalytic ability, the immobilized PersiManXyn1 could
   catalytically reduce the concentrated dye solutions within 150 s with
   superior reusability (94% dye removal after 15th cycle). Proficient
   treatment of a real textile effluent by the immobilized PersiManXyn1
   approved its practical applications in the water remediation.

AB Here, we propose a low-cost, sustainable, and viable adsorbent (pine
   tree-derived biochar) to remove acid dyes such as acid violet 17 (AV),
   which is used in the silk dyeing industry. As a case study, the AV
   removal process was demonstrated using synthetic effluent and further as
   a proof of concept using real dye effluent produced from the Sirumugai
   textile unit in India. The pine tree-derived biochar was selected for
   removal of aqueous AV dye in batch and fixed-bed column studies. The
   adsorbent material was characterized for crystallinity (XRD), surface
   area (BET), surface morphology and elemental compositions (SEM-EDX),
   thermal stability (TGA), weight loss (DGA), and functional groups
   (FTIR). Batch sorption studies were performed to evaluate (i) adsorption
   at various pH values (at pH 2 to 7), (ii) isotherms (at 10, 25, and 35
   degrees C) to assess the temperature effect on the sorption efficiency,
   and (iii) kinetics to reveal the effect of time, adsorbent dose, and
   initial concentration on the reaction rate. After systematic evaluation,
   2 g/L biochar, 25 mg/L AV, pH 3, 40 degrees C, and 40 and 360 min in a
   completely mixed batch study resulted in 50 and 90% dye removal,
   respectively. The isoelectric point at pH 3.7 +/- 0.2 results in maximum
   dye removal, therefore suggesting that monitoring the ratio of different
   effluent (acid/wash/dye) can improve the colorant removal efficiency.
   The Langmuir isotherm best fits with the sorption of AV to biochar,
   provided a maximal dye uptake of 29 mg/g at 40 degrees C, showing that
   adsorption was endothermic. Fixed-bed studies were conducted at room
   temperature with an initial dye concentration of 25 and 50 mg/L. The
   glass columns were packed with biochar (bed depth 20 cm, pore volume =
   14 mL) at an initial pH of 5.0 and a 10 mL/min flow rate for 120 min.
   Finally, the regeneration of the adsorbent was achieved using desorption
   studies conducted under the proposed experimental conditions resulted in
   90-93% removal of AV even after five cycles of regeneration.

AB An electrochemical oxidation using a boron-doped diamond electrode has
   been tested for the treatment of solutions miming a real wastewater,
   containing the Reactive Blue 19 dye, taken after the rinse and softening
   bath from a typical reactive dyes process. This effluent is a complex
   mixture of dyes, electrolytes at high concentration, mainly chlorides or
   sulphates and carbonates together with dyeing auxiliaries.
   Electrolyses were conducted in an undivided electrolytic cell under
   galvanostatic conditions.
   The effect of carbonate has been extensively investigated as well as pH,
   temperature and current density. The efficiency of the process has been
   evaluated in terms of colour, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total
   organic carbon (TOC) removal.
   Results show that colour removal was negatively affected by carbonates
   and favoured by both chlorides and additives while complete
   mineralisation was found to mainly depend only on temperature. The study
   of current density effect supports the hypothesis that discoloration
   mainly occurs via indirect oxidation mediated by electrogenerated active
   chlorine while COD and TOC removal is carried out by direct oxidation by
   means of hydroxyl radicals produced at BDD surface. (C) 2011 Elsevier

AB A pilot external-loop airlift reactor (ELAR) of 150 liters was designed
   and used as a non - conventional reactor to carry out
   Electrocoagulation/Electroflotation to treat real textile effluents
   containing disperse and reactive dyes. The designed reactor ensure the

   of the pollutants is achieved without additional mechanical power in the
   pilot external-loop airlift reactor (ELAR), using only the overall
   liquid recirculation induced by H2 microbubbles generated by water
   electrolysis without filtration process. Aluminum, iron electrodes and
   combined aluminum - iron electrodes were tested. The obtained results
   were interesting as they would help managing the
   Electrocoagulation/Electroflotation process in pilot external - loop
   airlift reactor to remove real textile effluent. The treatment of the
   mixtures of the real textile dyeing industry is better when using a
   combination of the electrodes of iron and aluminum providing a better
   treatment efficiency of 80% and a lower specific energy consumption (50
   kWh/kg dye). In order to analyze the by-product of the
   electrocoagulation (EC) and the treated effluent, different techniques
   were used to elucidate the role of different kind of anodes especially
   when the combined iron - aluminum were used simultaneously as
   sacrificial anodes.

   from water. Adsorption related experimental data is best fitted to
   Langmuir adsorption isotherm indicating that adsorption of SO dye onto
   MDMLG is uniform. Mono layer adsorption capacity of MDMLG is similar to
   3.92 x 10(-4) mol/g. Mean adsorption energy is similar to 36.23 kJ/mol
   indicating that chemisorption is the major mode of adsorption. Pseudo
   2nd order rate equation best describes the adsorption kinetics of SO dye
   onto MDMLG. Regeneration of SO dye in ethanol is similar to 73.5%, which

   dyes Direct Red 81 (DR81) and Rhodamine B (RHB), simulating one of the

   deoiled Argemone Mexicana seeds (A. Mexicana). The adsorption behaviour
   of DR81 and RHB dyes was simultaneously analyzed in the mixture using
   derivative spectrophotometric method. Central composite design (CCD) was
   employed for designing the experiments for this complex binary mixture
   where significance of important parameters and possible interactions
   were analyzed by response surface methodology (RSM). Maximum adsorption
   of DR81 and RHB by A. Mexicana was obtained at 53 degrees C after 63.33
   min with 0.1 g of adsorbent and 8 x 1(0-)6 M DR81, 12 x 10(-6) M RHB
   with composite desirability of 0.99. The predicted values for percentage
   removal of dyes from the mixture were in good agreement with the
   experimental values with R-2 > 96% for both the dyes. CCD superimposed
   RSM confirmed that presence of different dyes in a solution created a
   competition for the adsorbent sites and hence interaction of dyes was
   one of the most important factor to be studied to simulate the real
   effluent. The adsorbent showed remarkable adsorption capacities for both

   was optimized using response surface methodology based on a central
   composite design. Characteristics of natural sepiolite and modified
   sepiolite can be analyzed by FTIR and XRD techniques. In order to
   achieve a better comprehension of applicability of adsorbent for
   removing dyes from colored effluents, isotherm and kinetic studies were
   also carried out. The maximum dye removal of 78% and 72% for synthetic
   solutions and real wastewater, respectively, was obtained at the initial
   dye concentration of 77.1mg/L, contact time of 24.81min, solution pH of
   6.19 and adsorbent dosage of 1.03g/L. The kinetic studies revealed that
   the adsorption process followed pseudo-second-order model. The
   adsorption data were best fitted to Freundlich model. The result
   indicated that the contact time and dye concentration have more
   influence on the removal efficiency rather than pH and amount of
   adsorbent. The experimental data from this study indicated that the
   modified sepiolite is an efficient adsorbent for dye removal from
   aqueous solutions.

AB The objective of this work was to determine the optimal conditions for
   the electrooxidation treatment in order to decolourise the effluents
   that contain reactive dyes. According to the results, when Na2SO4 is
   used as an electrolyte, the decolouration reactions follow first-order
   kinetics. However, when NaCl is present in the effluent, the first-order
   kinetics is stabilised after applying a minimal electric current value.
   The models obtained from the results show that the higher the
   concentration of NaCl, the lower the energy consumption. On the other
   hand, an increase in dye concentration leads to an increase in
   electrical consumption. In relation to the pH, the results show that it
   is not a key factor in the decolouration efficiency. Finally, the
   obtained model was applied to two real effluents. The feasibility of
   individually treating the effluents from the dyeing process and those
   from the subsequent wash-off process was evaluated. From an industrial
   application point of view, it is recommended to mix both effluents
   before treatment, especially when the dye concentration is high.

AB Decolorization of dye wastewater before discharge is pivotal because of
   its immense color and toxicities. In this study, a granular activated
   carbon based microbial fuel cell (GACB-MFC) was used without using any
   expensive materials like Nafion membrane and platinum catalyst for
   simultaneous decolorization of real dye wastewater and bioelectricity
   generation. After 48 hours of GACB-MFC operation, 73% color was removed
   at anode and 77% color was removed at cathode. COD removal was 71% at
   the anode and 76% at the cathode after 48 hours. Toxicity measurements
   showed that cathode effluent was almost nontoxic after 24 hours. The
   anode effluent was threefold less toxic compared to original dye
   wastewater after 48 hours. The GACB-MFC produced a power density of 1.7
   W/m(3) with an open circuit voltage 0.45 V. One of the advantages of the
   GACB-MFC system is that pH was automatically adjusted from 12.4 to 7.2
   and 8.0 at the anode and cathode during 48 hours operation.

AB Fenton process was successfully applied to degrade three reactive dyes,
   blue 19 (RB19), red 195 (RR195), and yellow 145 (RY145), a mixture of
   dyes and a real textile effluent. A 2(3) full factorial design coupled
   with a response surface methodology (RSM) was conducted to evaluate the
   effects of H2O2, Fe2+, and dye concentration on the Fenton reaction
   measured by absorbance reduction (AR) as response. Considering the
   analysis of variance (ANOVA), the statistical models could be used to
   describe experimental results and to predict the process behavior. The
   results obtained by RSM indicated that the optimum conditions for Fenton
   were [H2O2] = 50 mg L-1, [Fe2+] = 0.5 mmol L-1, and dye concentration =
   0.075 g L-1, obtaining up to 90% of AR. From kinetic study, the
   absorbance reduction for RY145 followed a second-order model, while RB19
   and RR195 followed a first-order model. The mixture of dyes and the real
   textile effluent obtained lower AR, 56% and 22%, respectively. The
   phytotoxicity tests indicate that the Fenton reactions were very
   effective to reduce the toxicity of almost all contaminated solutions;
   however, for more complex solution (mixture of dyes and real effluents),
   a longer reactional time is necessary. Therefore, the results pointed
   that the Fenton reaction is very efficient in solution discoloration.

   (JSP) in adsorbing dye from raw textile effluent. Hence, different
   pretreatment techniques, i.e., radiation treatment, alkali treatment,
   ammonia treatment, steam treatment and CaCl2 treatment were applied to
   JSP and the adsorbing performance were examined for synthetic dye
   solutions (Blue FCL and Red RL dye). Different gamma radiation doses
   were applied on JSP and optimum dye removal efficiency was found at 500
   krad in removing these two dyes (50 ppm) from solutions. Among the
   different pretreatment techniques, gamma irradiated JSP (500 Krad)
   exhibits highest dye uptake capacity for RED RL dye, whereas
   steam-treated JSP shows highest performance in adsorbing blue FCL dye.
   Subsequently, we applied the gamma irradiated and steam-treated JSP on
   real textile effluent (RTE) and these two techniques shows potentiality
   in adsorbing dye from raw textile effluent and in reducing BOD5, COD
   load and TOC to some extent as well. Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis also proved that dye has been adsorbed on

AB In the present study, the response surface methodology (RSM) model was

   effluent by continuous electrocoagulation process using iron electrodes.
   The main effect of three parameters: initial pH, inlet flow rate and
   applied voltage along with their interaction on pollutants removal were
   evaluated. Results show that the increase of applied voltage and the
   decrease of inlet flow rate enhance the efficiencies of the pollutants
   removals. According to P values and analysis of variance ANOVA, there is
   a good adjustment between the second order regression models and
   experimental data for all responses. From surface plot analysis, it was
   well observed that the best pollutants removals were achieved at neutral
   pH range with the lowest flow rate and the highest voltage. When the
   conductivity removal was neglected, with the optimal parameters values:
   7.58 pH, 1 L/min inlet flow rate and 101 V applied voltage the color and

AB Synthetic dyes released by various industries pose a real concern to the
   environmental safety. Existing physico-chemical methods of dye removal
   from effluents suffer from severe constraints like low efficiency, high
   operational cost and large amount of sludge generation. Over the last
   two decades, considerable work has been done with the goal of using
   microorganisms as bioremediation agents in the treatment of dye
   containing wastewaters. Microorganisms are capable of removing dyes due
   to their high metabolic potential. Compared to bacteria and filamentous
   fungi, yeasts exhibit attractive features. In recent years, there has
   been intensive research on dye removal by yeast species. It is becoming
   a promising alternative to replace or supplement existing treatment
   processes. The present article provides a selective overview of past
   achievements and present scenario of using yeast for the removal of
   synthetic dyes from water environment. Updated information on the
   mechanism of dye removal by various yeast genera via processes like
   biosorption, bioaccumulation and biodegradation are discussed.

AB In the present study, we evaluate the behavior of real textile
   wastewater treatment using a system composed of two sequential
   pilot-scale reactors (anaerobic followed by aerobic) during 622 days.
   The work focused on the competition between color and sulfate removal
   processes, when the hydraulic retention time (HRT) was increased in the
   anaerobic/aerobic reactors from 16/12 hours in phase I (PI) to 4/3 days
   in phase II (PII). The organic matter was successfully removed in both
   phases through the system, and the highest efficiency (75%) was achieved
   in PII. The increase in the HRT did not improve azo dye degradation
   under anaerobic conditions. Instead, it favored sulfate reduction, which
   removal efficiency increased from 26% in PI to 75% in PII. Aromatic
   amines were detected in the anaerobic reactor effluent and removed in
   the aerobic reactor.

AB In the present study the feasibility of the use of a bacterial batch
   sequential anaerobic-aerobic process, in which activated sludge was used
   in both parts of the process, for pretreatment of wastewater generated
   by a textile dyeing factory has been considered. Activated sludge used
   in the process was obtained from a municipal wastewater treatment plant
   and adapted to real dyeing wastewater using either an anaerobic-only or
   an anaerobic-aerobic process over a period of 90 days. The use of
   activated sludge adapted using the anaerobic-aerobic process resulted in
   a higher overall decolorization efficiency compared to that achieved
   with activated sludge adapted using the anaerobic-only cycles. Anaerobic
   and aerobic periods of around 34 and 22 hours respectively resulted in
   an effluent with chemical oxygen demand (COD) and color content which
   met the standards for discharge into the centralized wastewater
   treatment plant of the industrial estate in which the dyeing factory was
   situated. Neutralization of the real dyeing wastewater and addition of
   carbon source to it, both of which results in significant increase in
   the cost of the bacterial treatment process, was not found to be
   necessary to achieve the required discharge standards.

AB Clays have been considered as potential alternative adsorbents due to
   their high adsorptive property, abundance and non-toxic compounds.
   Adsorption of cationic dyes by natural clays has been studied and
   appreciable results have been reported, but few researchers have been
   interested in anionic dyes. Anionic dyes are widely used by the textile
   industries, yet they are toxic, non-biodegradable and hardly adsorbable
   on natural clay; modified clay (e.g. organoclay) has emerged as an
   alternative adsorbent. In this study, organobentonites were prepared
   with hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide at three cation exchange
   capacity levels and used as adsorbents for the removal of, reactive blue
   II - an anionic dye used in Tunisian textile industry to dye jeans.
   Obtained organobentonite-labelled H-i-bent (I = 1, 2 and 3) was
   characterized by several techniques in order to study the effect of a
   surfactant on texture and structure of the initial clay. H-3-bent and
   purified bentonite (Na-bent) were then tested as adsorbents. The amount
   of dye removal by H-3-bent (98%) was found to be around five times
   higher than that of Na-bent (19%). Adsorption process was well described
   by Freundlich, Dubinin-Radushkevic and Elovich isotherms model. Kinetic
   data were fitted by both pseudo-second-order and pseudo-first-order
   models. The use of Na-bent, as adsorbent, for real textile effluent
   treatment was tested, and significant results related to two other clay
   minerals were obtained.

   (hexavalent chromium, Cr (VI)) simultaneously in a simulated wool dyeing

   simultaneously presented. Characterisations of TiO2/P-BNNSs were carried
   out by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Flourier transform infrared spectroscopy
   (FTIR), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and N2 adsorption
   desorption equilibrium. Application of TiO2/P-BNNSs for the treatment of
   LR2B alone, Cr (VI) alone and their mixture in the simulated wool dyeing
   bath was discussed. Both LR2B and Cr (VI) removal were decreased in the

   their respective binary systems (LR2B/(TiO2/P-BNNSs) or Cr
   (VI)/(TiO2/P-BNNSs)) in the simulated wool dyeing bath. In spite of
   these decreases, simultaneousLR2B and Cr (VI) removal was achieved after

AB Water soluble unfixed dyes and inorganic salts are the major pollutants
   in textile dyeing industry wastewater. Existing treatment methods fail
   to degrade textile dyes and have limitations too. The inadequate
   treatment of textile dyeing wastewater is a major concern when effluent
   is directly discharged into the nearby environment. Long term disposal
   threatens the environment, which needs reclamation. This article reviews
   the current knowledge of nano zero valent iron (nZVI) technique in the
   degradation of textile dyes. The application of nZVI on textile dye
   degradation is receiving great attention in the recent years because
   nZVI particles are highly reactive towards the pollutant, less toxic,
   and economical. The nZVI particles aggregate quickly with respect to
   time and the addition of supports such as resin, nickel, zinc,
   bentonite, biopolymer, kaolin, rectorite, nickel-montmorillonite,
   bamboo, cellulose, biochar, graphene, and clinoptilolite enhanced the
   stability of iron nanoparticles. Inclusion of supports may in turn
   introduce additional toxic pollutants, hence green supports are
   recommended. The majority of investigations concluded dye color removal
   as textile dye compound removal, which is not factual. Very few studies
   monitored the removal of total organic carbon and observed the products
   formed. The results revealed that partial mineralization of the textile
   dye compound was achieved. Instead of stand alone technique, nZVI can be
   integrated with other suitable technique to achieve complete degradation
   of textile dye and also to treat multiple pollutants in the real textile
   dyeing wastewater. It is highly recommended to perform more bench-scale
   and pilot-scale studies to apply this technique to the textile effluent
   contaminated sites. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Dyes used in the textile industry can easily contaminate water and are
   becoming a world-wide pollution problem. The efficiency of colour
   removal process from artificially prepared and actual textile wastewater
   using electrocoagulation (EC) was investigated in this study. A disperse
   dye was selected for the synthetic dye wastewater experiments. Different
   operating conditions such as dye concentration, pH, conductivity values
   and current density (CD) were investigated using synthetically prepared
   dye solution in a batch EC reactor with parallel-connected electrodes.
   EC optimum working conditions for decolourisation rate of 50 mg/L
   synthetic dye solution were found as current density of 30-37.5
   mA/cm(2), conductivity value of 1 mS/cm, pH value of 7.5 at 25 degrees C
   for both Al and Fe electrodes in this experimental work. Additionally, a
   real textile wastewater was tested at similar experimental conditions
   achieved with synthetic dye solution using a batch EC reactor. Dye
   removal rate was achieved as %80 with real wastewater with energy
   consumption of 9.16 kWh/m(3).

AB This work aims to study the treatment (decolorization) of real
   industrial dyeing effluents originated directly from the dyeing bath,
   before entering the equalization tank (instead of treating the whole
   volume of wastewater) using chitosan beads as adsorbents. The addition
   of amido and imino groups on chitosan backbone through grafting
   reactions increased the adsorption capacity of adsorbents, while the
   cross-linking method made them capable of reuse for ten cycles at least
   without significant loss of their capacity (similar to 5%). The imino
   grafted derivative with a dosage of 5 g/L resulted in a residual dye
   content < 1 mg/L, which is in accordance with the limitations of
   legislation. Swelling experiments demonstrated low swelling percentages
   (similar to 35%) for the prepared adsorbents. Equilibrium data were
   successfully fitted to the Langmuir-Freundlich model (L-F). Kinetic data
   were fitted to a proposed detailed mathematical model, based on the
   chemical structure of chitosan and on a valid single-component adsorbate
   approximation, resulting in diffusion coefficients of dyes in the triple
   dye mixture (both in simulated/synthetic and real effluents). A
   commercial form of activated carbon was used, to compare and confirm the
   high adsorption capacity and easy/successful regeneration of the
   prepared chitosan derivatives (through adsorption-desorption experiments
   in real effluent). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Chlorophenols constitute a group of priority pollutants widely found in
   industrial wastewaters and often originate from dye works. In the
   present work, a combined AOP treatment using a KrCl UV excilamp with
   hydrogen peroxide has been tested for the degradation of 4-chlorophenol
   in the presence of a common dye, methyl green. The presence of the dye
   constitutes a first step in order to simulate a real effluent and study
   how the different compounds present can affect the degradation of
   phenolics. The obtained results have shown that variation of the dye
   concentration, in the range 25 to 100 mg L-1, does not affect
   chlorophenol degradation, while, on the contrary, lower 4-chlorophenol
   initial concentrations lead to faster removal of the dye. A molar ratio
   hydrogen peroxide: 4-chlorophenol of 25: 1 was determined to be the
   optimum one.

AB Dye wastewater is one of typically non-biodegradable industrial
   effluents. A new process linking Fenton's oxidation with biological
   oxidation proposed in this study was investigated to degrade the organic
   substances from real dye wastewater. During the combination process, the
   Fenton's oxidation process can reduce the organic load and enhance
   biodegradability of dye wastewater, which is followed by biological
   aerated filter (BAF) system to further remove organic substances in
   terms of discharge requirement. The results showed that 97.6% of
   chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal by the combination process was
   achieved at the optimum process parameters: pH of 3.5, H2O2 of 2.0 mL/L,
   Fe(II) of 500 mg/L, 2.0 h treatment time in the Fenton's oxidation
   process and hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 5 h in the BAF system.
   Under these conditions, COD concentration of effluent was 72.6 mg/L
   whereas 3020 mg/L in the influent, thus meeting the requirement of
   treated dye wastewater discharge performed by Chinese government (less
   than 100 mg/L). These results obtained here suggest that the new process
   combining Fenton's oxidation with biological oxidation may provide an
   economical and effective alternative for treatment of non-biodegradable
   industrial wastewater.

   to estimate the kinetic parameter of ozonation. The effect of ozone
   concentration, agitation speed were studied to give the best performance
   of color and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal. The result indicated
   38.12% of COD removal and 92.53% of color removal using EC with Al/Al
   electrodes for 10 minutes. The effluent was pumped to ozonation process
   for further COD removal. The result showed that 1 mg/L ozon was needed
   to destroy 4.73 mg/L COD. At ozonation process, the COD removal was
   87.4% using 5.8% mol ozone at 400 rpm for 60 minutes. The kinetic
   parameter was estimated based on the experimental data. The reaction
   rate constant was 173.5 cm(3)/(g sec).

AB Azo dyes are one of the most important groups of synthetic dyes. These
   dyes are compounds resistant against decomposition by biological
   processes and are used in textile industries. The aim of this study was
   to decoloration of textile Acid Red 18 dye by hybrid UV/catalytic
   ozonation process (COP) advanced oxidation process (AOP) using ZnO
   (synthesized by thermal method) as a catalyst, immobilized on a stone
   surface. The process efficiency was investigated using parameters of pH,
   contact time, catalyst concentration and initial concentration of dye in
   the hybrid process. Dye removal mechanisms were identified in the sole
   ozonation process, COP and photocatalytic process (UV/ ZnO). X-ray
   diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron
   microscopy analyses were used to study the structural properties,
   morphology, and size of the ZnO nanoparticles. 97% dye removal was
   obtained at a contact time of 40 min, pH: 5, catalyst concentration of 3
   g/L and dye initial concentration of 25 mg/L. The Yazdbaf textile
   factory wastewater was selected as a real sample and its physicochemical
   quality was determined. Also, the Acid Red 18 dye removal efficiency was
   obtained 65% in the optimal conditions. Kinetic studies showed that the
   decomposition reaction follows pseudo-first-order kinetics. The UV/COP
   hybrid process as an AOP has high efficiency in removing resistant dye
   contaminants from textile wastewater.

AB Fimbristylis dichotoma, Ammannia baccifera and their co-plantation

   mixture and real textile effluent. Wild plants of F. dichotoma and A.
   baccifera with equal biomass showed 91% and 89% decolorization of Methyl
   Orange within 60 hat a concentration of 50 ppm, while 95% dye removal
   was achieved by consortium FA within 48 h. Floating phyto-beds with
   co-plantation (F. dichotoma and A. baccifera) for the treatment of real
   textile effluent in a constructed wetland was observed to be more
   efficient and achieved 79%, 72%, 77%, 66% and 56% reductions in ADMI
   color value, COD, BOD, TDS and TSS of textile effluent, respectively.
   HPTLC, GC-MS, STIR, UV vis spectroscopy and activated oxido-reductive
   enzyme activities confirmed the phytotrasformation of parent dye in to
   new metabolites. T-RFLP analysis of rhizospheric bacteria of F.
   dichotoma, A. baccifera and consortium FA revealed the presence of 88,
   98 and 223 genera which could have been involved in dye removal.
   Toxicity evaluation of products formed after phytotransformation of
   Methyl Orange by consortium FA on bivalves Lamellidens marginalis
   revealed less damage of the gills architecture when analyzed
   histologically. Toxicity measurement by Random Amplification of
   Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique revealed bivalve DNA banding pattern in

AB Coagulation-flocculation (CF) process studies on aqueous solutions of
   Acid Black 210 dye (AB-210), were performed to investigate efficiency at
   different pH, coagulant and polyelectrolyte doses. and sedimentation
   times. In the adsorption studies of the dye removal, the initial pH and
   isotherms studies were performed using an activated carbon prepared by
   microwave-assisted pyrolysis of Tannery sludge. This adsorbent material
   was characterized by isotherms of N-2 adsorption-desorption and density
   functional theory. Finally, the efficiency of the combined process CF
   followed by adsorption, was shown using a synthetic effluent identical
   to that produced in the wet-end process of the leather industry in
   industrial equipment. Effluent was collected from each treatment bath
   and analyzed for its physical properties and by ion chromatography.
   The best conditions found in CF processes were: pH 10.0, sedimentation
   time of 60 minutes, coagulant dose of 71 mg L-1 (Al-2(SO4)(3)) and dose
   of flocculant (polyelectrolyte FX AS1) of 0.090 mg In the adsorption
   processes, the equilibrium data were best fit to the L-1 isotherm model,
   presenting the maximum sorption capacity (Q(max)) for AB-210 of 974.7 mg
   g(-1) at 303.15K at pH 2.0. Using the synthetic effluent, the combined
   CF followed by adsorption of AB-210 dye demonstrated a removal of 85.2%,
   indicating that the combined process is efficient for real wastewater
   treatment.

AB Mixed azo dyes present in various effluents may often impair adsorption
   efficiency thereby questioning applicability of the same in a real-time
   scenario. In this study, simultaneous adsorption of acid yellow 36 (AY)
   and acid blue 74 (AB) from their aqueous solutions was carried out with
   graphene oxide nanoplatelets embedded in chitosan matrix (GO-Cs-Nc) with
   assistance of ultrasound exposure. Results obtained were subjected to
   analysis for process isotherms, kinetics and thermodynamics. This
   process was also optimized for best results using response surface
   methodology (RSM) and modelled with artificial neural network (ANN). The
   nanocomposite was characterised both before and after adsorption using
   FTIR, SEM, TEM and AFM. Under the experimental conditions prescribed by
   RSM, 0.50 g L-1 of adsorbent was responsible for 98.18% and 98.80%
   removal of AY and AB respectively when exposed to 6.48 min of ultrasonic
   irradiation. Hence, ultrasound assisted GO-Cs-Nc proved to be a cost
   effective and sustainable adsorbent effective in low dosage and
   significantly reduced time with possible application for treatment of
   real industrial effluents rich in mixed dyes. (C) 2016 Institution of

   parameters of current density, anode type, temperature, pH, and
   electrolyte concentration on the removal of Reactive Red 120 in
   synthesized wastewater through electrocoagulation using solar energy for
   the purpose of improving economic efficiency of the process. Current
   density of 45 Am-2 proved to be optimum level for dye removal. Other
   optimum alternatives were iron anode, a temperature level of 25 degrees
   C, a pH of 7, and an electrolyte concentration of 15 mg L-1. The
   characterization of the post-treatment product using GC-MS studies
   revealed intermediate compounds. Cost analysis was also performed for
   the treatment process. Further, the obtained optimum conditions were
   applied to the treatment of six samples of real textile effluent.
   Electrocoagulation was satisfactory in only four of the cases. Lastly,
   efficiency of treating the real samples was evaluated by subjecting the
   experimental electrodes to the SEM technique. (C) 2014 King Saud

AB Jatropha curcas is a non-edible oil crop predominately used to produce
   biodiesel. J. curcas pod contains 80% as dried vegetable and remaining
   20% are seeds that are used for the biodiesel production in industries.
   In the present study, J. curcas pods were used for activated carbon
   preparation and successfully employed as adsorbent for the removal of
   reactive dye, Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR). Batch adsorption
   experiments were performed as a function of contact time, pH, adsorbent
   dosage and initial dye concentration. The experimental results indicate
   that 0.2 g of activated carbon removed 95% of 50 mg L-1 dye. Adsorption
   data were modeled using the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. Langmuir
   isotherm was obeyed for the adsorption. Equilibrium parameter value
   (R-L) was observed to be in the range of 0-1. The dye adsorption
   followed the pseudo-first-order kinetics model with regard to the
   intraparticle diffusion rate. Physico-chemical properties of activated
   carbon were analyzed by SEM, FTIR and XRD before and after dye
   adsorption. The adsorbed dye from activated carbon was successfully
   desorbed (80%) by 1 N NaOH. Bench scale removal of RBBR dye as well as
   real textile effluent was carried out by J. curcas pods activated carbon
   (JCPAC). This option will make the agro-industrial waste JCPAC adopted
   in textile industrial effluent treatment for environmental cleansing.

AB In order to deal with the contamination of dyes in wastewater, a new
   kind of magnetic strongly basic anion-exchange resin (noted as CDD-1)
   was prepared and characterized in this study. Batch experiments were
   performed to investigate its adsorption behaviors of two acid dyes
   sunset yellow (FCF) and acid green (AG9) under different experimental
   conditions. The reusability and adsorption performance of CDD-1 resin
   for biologically treated dyeing effluents treatment were also evaluated.
   The maximum adsorption capacity of FCF and AG9 onto CDD-1 resin at 308 K
   were 1.85 and 1.44 mmol/g, respectively. When the initial concentrations
   of two dyes were 0.05, 0.25 and 0.50 mmol/L, the initial adsorption
   rates of FCF were 1.76, 4.09 and 7.37 times higher than that of AG9,
   respectively. The FCF appeared a homogeneous monolayer chemisorption,
   while the AG9 adsorption was more like a multilayer adsorption,
   indicating other interactions except ion exchange may occur during the
   AG9 adsorption. The CDD-1 resin could be reused with most of its virgin
   adsorption capacity (93.6% for FCF and 78.9% for AG9) after 10
   successive adsorption-desorption cycles. For real dyeing effluents
   treatment by the CDD-1 resin, the removal efficiencies of color degree
   were more than 90%, while that of CODcr were about 35-60%, which
   rendered it great potential for advanced treatment of dyeing effluents.

AB In this study, working of hybrid anaerobic-aerobic biological treatment
   technology for real textile wastewater was investigated on the basis of
   system evaluation and optimization in two phases. In Phase I, system was
   optimized at laboratory scale on synthetic textile wastewater and later
   real textile wastewater was treated in Phase II. The study was conducted
   for 242 days in which industrial discharge coming from textile mill was
   collected and subjected to laboratory scale hybrid treatment. Activated
   sludge used in the process was obtained from full scale membrane
   bioreactor (MBR) plant and adapted to the synthetic and real textile
   wastewater using anaerobic process. Individual application of anaerobic
   treatment was found to be insufficient for the removal of COD, TKN and
   dyes. The proposed combine hybrid anaerobic-aerobic system was found to
   be effective in reporting removal efficiencies of 99.5% COD, 99.3% TKN,
   and 78.4% dyes. The anaerobic SBR added value to the hybrid system as it
   played a key role in improving treatment efficiency in addition to the
   production of sustainable energy source of biogas. Study shows that
   aerobic treatment is required to increase the treatment level by
   providing the final polishing to anaerobically treated effluent in order
   to reclaim water. The optimum HRT for hybrid anaerobic-aerobic system in
   treating real textile wastewater was found to be 54 h for maximum COD
   removal. The implication of this work is the industrial application of
   hybrid anaerobic-aerobic system for reuse of water in agricultural and
   industrial sectors.

   (NF) process were utilized as a hybrid method for decolorization and
   purification of textile wastewater. Highly soluble Reactive Blue 21
   (RB21) and Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS) were used as dye and anionic
   surfactant in the wastewater, respectively. The behavior of SBR was
   investigated during different periods of anaerobic-aerobic phases and
   pollutant reduction performance of each treatment section was analyzed.
   Experimental results of biological treatment showed that the presence of
   SDS in wastewater could enhance dye and chemical oxygen demand (COD)
   removal performance. The SBR effluents with an optimum ratio of
   anaerobic-aerobic phases (8 h:13 h) were used as feed for nanofiltration
   membrane. Although membrane procedure could not significantly separate
   the SDS present in wastewater, yet it could remove 96% of dye and 97 %
   of COD. Also, real textile wastewater was treated by the earlier
   mentioned hybrid method. Analyzing the effluent showed that dye, COD,
   and SDS removal were 98%, 98.5%, and 99%, respectively. During the
   treatment process, Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), Total Organic Carbon
   (TOC), turbidity and hardness were 20 +/- 10 mg/L, 17 +/- 2 mg/L, 1.31
   +/- 0.15 NTU and 21 +/- 4 mg/L, respectively.

AB Integrated water resources management practice is gaining popularity as
   an alternative water source due to the limited supply of freshwater. The
   present study was carried out on the photocatalytic degradation of
   Direct red 28 (DR-28) dye using magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs; Fe3O4) as
   a photocatalyst. The study was conducted on the photocatalytic
   degradation of DR-28 dye in synthetic dye effluent water, to understand
   the effects of different photoreaction parameters on the degradation
   kinetics. The influence of different parameters such as time, amount of
   photocatalyst, concentration of H2O2 and pH was investigated. At the
   optimum dosage of MNPs (0.6g/L) with 4mmol/L of H2O2, significant
   photocatalytic degradation of DR-28 dye (93.2%) was observed. The
   kinetic study revealed that the photocatalytic degradation followed
   pseudo-first-order kinetics. The degradation performance of Fe3O4
   nanoparticles as a photocatalyst for DR-28 dye was compared with
   titanium dioxide (TiO2) and it was found that the performance of Fe3O4
   as a photocatalyst is superior to TiO2 photocatalyst. The real dye
   effluent was also degraded at optimum conditions and promising results
   were achieved.

AB Ozone has been applied for the advanced treatment of textile wastewater
   containing a large number of indigestible dyes and other macromolecular
   organics. However, due to the poor mass transfer performance of ozone,
   the efficiency of ozonation was limited, resulted in high operating
   cost. In the present work, the de gradation of dyes and real textile
   wastewater by hydrodynamic cavitation combined with ozone (HC + O-3) was
   studied in a small-scale pilot plant operating at a capacity of 40 L.
   The treatment of single HC and HC + Air had minute dye removal within
   180 min whereas the treatment of HC + O-3 and single O-3 could degrade
   the dyes effectively in 10 min. The removal efficiency of dyes followed
   the order HC + O-3 single O-3 > HC + Air > single HC. The synergetic
   coefficient of HC + O-3 was 1.33, which indicated that HC and O-3 had
   noteworthy synergistic effect in the hybrid system. For the real textile
   wastewater, the removal rates of HC + O-3 on COD, TOC, UV254 and color
   were 36%, 23%, 71% and 90% in 30 min, which was higher than the single
   treatment. The removal of UV254 and color showed that macromolecular
   organics and residual dyes were effectively degraded. Among these
   treatments, HC + O-3 was the most energy-efficient. Therefore, HC + O-3
   could be used as a potential dye degradation technology and would have a
   promising engineering application value in the real textile wastewater
   advanced treatment.

AB The aim of this work was to test the efficiency of a new photocatalytic
   reactor made of recycled materials. To perform this stu dy a textile
   effluent was treated by different AOPs and the solar/H2O2/TiO2suported
   method showed the higher percentage of degradation after the reaction
   time. Through a factorial design, it was possible to find the more
   significant variable in order to reach higher percentages of
   degradation. The performance of the reactor with recirculation allowed
   obtaining degradation kinetics parameters by adjusting the removals to a
   second order model, with k dyes = 0.175 L. mol(-1). s(-1) and 90% of dye
   removal after 30 min for the solar/H2O2/TiO2suported system. The use of
   artificial neural network was proven to be efficient to predict the
   degradation of a real effluent, with an absolute error of 0.02266. Other
   parameters such as COD, apparent color and nitrate were importantly
   reduced after treatment. The use of the reactor made of recycled
   material (PET) brings economic advantages, due to the low cost of the
   used materials and its respective easy construction. The treatment with
   the new reactor is suitable for the removal of contaminants from textile
   effluents since it presented higher efficiency than the conventional
   treatment used in the textile industry under study.

AB The textile dyeing industry produces large volumes of wastewater during
   dyeing processes where the major step includes the color removal and COD
   removal. In the present study, the combined electrooxidation process and
   a novel biological degradation at high compressed gas pressure were
   studied. The removal of color in the real textile dye effluent was
   achieved by electrooxidation with Titanium Substrate Insoluble anode and
   titanium as cathode through generation of hypochlorite. The hypochlorite
   produced during the electrooxidation was removed by exposing the
   solution to direct sunlight. The impact of compressed atmospheric
   condition on the degradation of organics by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MTCC
   No.1201, GenBank Acc. No KC545414) was studied. The compressed gas
   pressure condition increases the level of dissolved gas in the liquid
   phase and exerts the pressure on the growing cells in the liquid phase.
   Interesting synchronization between the utilization of oxygen by active
   microbial cells and the dissolution of oxygen in the water from gas
   phase was observed which enhanced the bacterial degradation process. It
   should be mentioned here that the P. aeruginosa was grown without
   addition of nutrients. The compressed atmospheric pressure enhances the
   bacterial proliferation, EPS production and COD reduction in the
   electrooxidized effluent. FTIR and HPLC reveal the degradation of
   organics in the compressed pressure condition.

AB Adsorption is a promising technique for decolorization of effluents of
   textile dyeing industries but its application is limited due to
   requirement of high amounts of adsorbent required. The objective of this
   study was to assess the potential of cadmium telluride nanoparticles
   loaded onto activated carbon (CdTN-AC) for the removal of sunset yellow
   (SY) dye from aqueous solution. Adsorption studies were conducted in a
   batch mode varying solution pH, contact time, initial dye concentration,
   CdTN-AC dose, and temperature. In order to investigate the efficiency of
   SY adsorption on CdTN-AC, pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order.
   Elovich, and intra-particle diffusion kinetic models were studied. It
   was observed that the pseudo-second-order kinetic model fits better than
   other kinetic models with good correlation coefficient. Equilibrium data
   were fitted to the Langmuir model. Thermodynamic parameters such as
   enthalpy, entropy, activation energy, and sticking probability were also
   calculated. It was found that the sorption of SY onto CdTN-AC was
   spontaneous and endothermic in nature. The proposed adsorbent is
   applicable for SY removal from waste of real effluents including
   pea-shooter, orange drink and jelly banana with efficiency more than
   97%. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Novelty Statement This study used an algal (Oscillatoria sp.,)
   biosorbent isolated from textile effluents, and it was acclimatized to a
   particular effluent (synthetic dye). This biosorbent was prepared using
   the sonication method and sieved using a 50-mu m mesh. With this novel
   approach of biosorbent preparation (acclimatization and sonication),
   this study demonstrated the maximum adsorption capacity of malachite
   green at 757 mg g(-1) biosorbent under optimized conditions (1.2 g of
   biosorbent, pH 8.5, and a contact time of 30 min). This algal biosorbent
   and preparation methods will have a huge impact on the wastewater
   treatment technology and possible applications at a large scale.
   Synthetic dyes are toxic and their release into the environment harms
   the ecosystem. Phycoremediation of synthetic dyes with acclimatized and
   native species has advantages over other methods. In this study, textile
   effluent-acclimatized microalgae species of Oscillatoria were grown in
   Bold's Basal Medium (BBM), dried, powdered using sonication, and
   optimized the removal malachite green (MG), using the response surface
   methodology (RSM). The effects of algal biosorbent concentration (AC),
   pH, and contact time (CT) were studied with 1 g L-1 MG in an aqueous
   solution, and the interaction model exerted significance (p < 0.001).
   The removal of MG was higher at alkaline pH (90% at pH 8.5) than at
   acidic pH (70% at pH 4). Under the optimized conditions of 1.2 g L-1 AC,
   8.5 pH, and 30 min CT, the MG removal was documented at 90.8% with the
   biosorption capacity of 757 mg g(-1). Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed the
   occurrence of different electronegative functional groups, aromatic
   vibrations, and the crystalline nature of the biosorbent. The algal
   sorbent exhibited a good performance of 80.9% for the removal of the
   crude color in real textile effluents. This microalgal sorbent is an
   attractive option for promoting large-scale applications.

AB An integrated system comprising coagulation, hydrolysis acidification,
   and multilevel contact oxidation was evaluated to make the dyeing
   effluent meet discharge standards. A new spiral biological carrier was
   first used in the treatment of dyeing wastewater. The chemical oxygen
   demand (COD), color, and biodegradability index (i.e., biological oxygen
   demand (BOD)/COD) of raw dyeing wastewater were 5051 mg/L, 404 times,
   and 0.29, respectively. During coagulation, 80% COD and 64% color were
   reduced with 80 mg/L polyaluminum chloride as coagulant. The hydraulic
   retention time (HRT) of subsequent hydrolysis acidification and
   multilevel contact oxidation was determined as 23.6 h. After the
   integrated treatment of coagulation-hydrolysis acidification-multilevel
   contact oxidation, COD, BOD, color, and ammonia removal efficiencies
   reached 98%, 99%, 92%, and 99%, respectively. The effluent met Class 1
   discharge standards (GB4287-2012). In particular, the new spiral
   biological carriers used in multilevel contact oxidation led to
   significant total nitrogen (TN) removal. When the HRT of multilevel
   contact oxidation process was 16.4 h, the TN removal efficiency was
   73.3%. The spiral carriers can provide an anoxic microenvironment in the
   inner part because of their high strength spiral structure, which
   facilitates the transformation from nitrate to nitrogen gas through
   simultaneous nitrification and denitrification. (c) 2014 American

AB Textile effluent is often difficult to manage as it contains a high
   concentration of toxic and recalcitrant synthetic dyes. In this study,
   congo Red and textile effluent were treated by electrochemical oxidation
   using RuO2-IrO2 coated titanium electrode as an anode followed by
   biodecolorization using Pseudomonas stutzeri MN1 and Acinetobacter
   baumannii MN3. Effluent pre-treatment is often necessary to minimize the
   inhibitory effects of textile dyes on dye degrading bacterial during
   bio-treatment. The pre-treatment of Congo Red by electrochemical
   oxidation for 10 min resulted in a decolorization rate of 98% at a pH,
   NaCl concentration, and current density of 7, 2 g L-1, and 20 mA cm(-2).
   Subsequent bio-treatment of the pretreated Congo Red enhanced the
   biodegradation to 93%. The COD removal efficiency in real textile
   effluent following electrochemical pretreatment and biological treatment
   using bacterial consortium were 3.8% and 93%, respectively. Therefore,
   integrating electrochemical oxidation and microbial consortia offers an
   effective and environmentally friendly approach for treating complex
   industrial effluents.

AB Thiourea was successfully deposited on the surface of Fe3O4
   nanoparticles (via a one-pot reaction with formaldehyde) for the purpose
   of developing a new adsorbent (MNPs-TF). The application of MNPs-TF to
   capture congo red (CR) and methyl orange (MO) as model examples of
   anionic dyes from their aqueous solutions was assessed. Several
   physicochemical parameters of pH, MNPs-TF dosage, dyes concentrations,
   residence time, temperature, and co-interfering ions were exhaustively
   trialed to comprehend the corresponding distribution of dyes species
   onto MNPs-TF at the molecular scale. To better interpret the adsorption
   process, kinetics, isotherm, and thermodynamics were proficiently
   modeled. Collectively, the findings pave that the dyes removal pathway
   was favorable in the acidic environment (pH0 = 3.8). Moreover, the
   kinetics data were more reliable to be matched with pseudo-second-order
   rate equation, whereas the equilibrium isotherms insights extrapolated
   that the adsorption process was dominated by Langmuir assumption with
   maximum loading capacities of 0.56 mmol g-1 and 1.43 mmol g-1 for CR,
   and MO, respectively. What is more, the temperature profiles studies
   suggested the exothermic nature of the process. Interestingly, the
   synthesized adsorbent possessed high recyclability of > 92% up to the
   6th cycle. The potency of MNPs-TF as point-of-use color collecting
   candidates from real dyeing effluents was accomplished.

AB The potential of an activated carbon prepared from an agricultural
   by-product for the removal of a tannery dye from aqueous solution was
   investigated. The effects of contact time, solution pH and temperature
   were evaluated. The results indicated that the equilibrium data were
   perfectly represented using a Langmuir isotherm. The maximum monolayer
   adsorption capacity was found to be 146.31 mg g(-1) at 25 degrees C. The
   kinetic studies indicated that the adsorption process followed a
   pseudo-second-order model. The application of an intra-particle
   diffusion model revealed that the adsorption mechanism of the concerned
   dye is a rather complex process and that diffusion is involved in the
   overall rate of the adsorption process, but it is not the only
   rate-controlling step. The calculated thermodynamics parameters revealed
   the spontaneous and endothermic nature of the adsorption process. The
   activation energy, E-a = 9.50 kJ mol(-1), could indicate a physical
   adsorption process. Despite the presence of other components in the real
   effluent, the adsorbent was able to remove the target dye. The present
   study indicates that activated carbon prepared from olive-waste cakes is
   a promising candidate as a low cost adsorbent for the removal of a
   tannery dye from industrial wastewater. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

   (pH, conductivity and COD) in order to verify the applicability of this
   treatment process. However, a partial elimination of COD and colour
   effluent were achieved, 12% and 21%, respectively. Therefore, new set of
   experiments were carried out where COD of textile effluent was
   completely reduced by applying 60 mA cm(-2) in presence of Na2SO4 and
   NaCl; reducing the time of depuration and consequently, the costs,
   confirming the potential efficiency of this dyestuff treatment.

AB The textile industry is responsible for one of the biggest environmental
   contamination problems in the world because they release unwanted dye
   effluents. This work proposes the use of polymer materials and
   nanomaterials in combination to address these difficulties in a variety
   of ways. In order to create a thin film-based membrane material for the
   removal of dye pollutants, ZIF-8 nanomaterial has been introduced into
   poly sulfone (PSf) and Chitosan (CS) blend polymeric material by phase
   inversion process. The physiochemical characteristics of pre-pared thin
   film membrane materials were investigated by using various techniques
   such as FT-IR, XRD, FE-SEM, AFM, BET, TGA and Mechanical strength
   analysis. Four common organic dyes Methylene Blue (MB), Rhodamine Blue
   (Rh. B), Acid Blue (AB) and Congo Red (CR) were used in dye adsorption
   tests. When the prepared material was tested with a sample of the
   effluent from the textile industry, the concentrations of all
   physio-chemical parameters indicated a considerable decrease when
   comparison to the concentration in the real textile effluent. In
   addition, the cytotoxicity analysis of the water samples and membrane
   samples was tested on human monocytic cell lines (THP-1) using flow
   cytometer. Furthermore, the composition of ZIF-8@PSf/CS membrane
   material displayed remarkable anti-bacterial characteristics for both
   gramme positive and gramme negative strains of Staphylococcus aureus and
   pseudomonas aeruginosa.

AB The indigo blue dye is widely used in the textile industry, specifically
   in jeans dyeing, the effluents of which, rich in organic pollutants with
   recalcitrant characteristics, end up causing several environmental
   impacts, requiring efficient treatments. Several pieces of research have
   been conducted in search of effective treatment methods, among which is
   electrocoagulation. This treatment consists of an electrochemical
   process that generates its own coagulant by applying an electric current
   on metallic electrodes, bypassing the use of other chemical products.
   The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential use of iron slag
   in the electrocoagulation of a synthetic effluent containing commercial
   indigo blue dye and the effluent from a textile factory. The quantified
   parameters were color, turbidity, pH, electrical conductivity, sludge
   generation, phenol removal, chemical oxygen demand (COD), and total
   organic carbon (TOC). The electrocoagulation treatment presented a good
   efficiency in removing the analyzed parameters, obtaining average
   removal in the synthetic effluent of 85% of color and 100% of phenol
   after 25 min of electrolysis. For the effluent from the textile factory,
   average reductions of 80% of color reaching 177.54 mg Pt CoL-1, 91% of
   turbidity reaching 93.83 NTU (nephelometric turbidity unit), 100% of
   phenol, 55% of COD with a final concentration of 298.8 mg O-2 L-1, and
   73% of TOC with a final concentration of 56.21 mg L-1, in 60 min of
   electrolysis. The reduced time for removal of color and phenolic
   compounds in synthetic effluent demonstrates the complexity of treating
   the real effluent since to obtain removals of the same order a 60-min
   period of electrolysis was necessary. The results obtained demonstrate
   the potential of using iron slag as an electrode in the
   electrocoagulation process in order to reuse industrial waste and reduce
   costs in the treatment and disposal of solid waste. Thus, the slag can
   be seen as an alternative material to be used in electrocoagulation
   processes for the treatment of effluents from the textile industry under
   the experimental conditions presented, its only limitation being the
   fact that it is a waste and therefore does not have a standardization in
   the amounts of iron present in the alternative electrodes.

AB The dyes used in textile industries are usually difficult to degrade in
   aquatic environments, being highly toxic to micro fauna and flora. Thus,
   textile wastewater treatments have been developed, among them, one that
   stands out is adsorption process. With the rise of nanomaterials applied
   to adsorption, graphene oxide (GO) shows promise in the removal of dyes.
   This work aimed to produce a more economical and environmentally
   friendly GO by reducing H2SO4 concentration during the synthesis.
   Adsorption tests were performed with methylene blue (MB) and brilliant
   blue (BB), adsorbent regeneration tests, as well as a kinetic study
   using real wastewater, and toxicological assays with lettuce seeds.
   Results showed that the sample produced with less H2SO4 (GO-21)
   performed better for MB (99% removal) and BB (29% removal); and
   recycling test showed that despite the decrease in removal efficiency,
   it remained high in the first cycles. Kinetics showed that equilibrium
   was reached in 30 min, removing 67.43% of color and 90.23% of the
   effluent's turbidity. Phytotoxicity assays indicated that the wastewater
   treated with GO-21 was the least toxic, compared to other wastewater
   samples analyzed. Therefore, GO has demonstrated its potential to be an
   effective and less toxic option to treat textile effluents.

AB In this work, the biosorption ability of Sarocladium sp. dried biomass
   to remove Remazol Black dye has been studied. Optimum inoculum size and
   initial dye concentration were determined, and the salinity effect on
   the dye removal was evaluated. In the following, kinetic and isotherm of
   the adsorption were studied, and the adsorbent characteristics were
   determined using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR),
   scanning electron microscopy, zeta potential, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller
   analysis. Based on the results, maximum and minimum dye removal was
   determined at 1000 and 200 mg L-1 of Remazol Black dye as 54.39 and
   24.02 mg g(-1), respectively. Among the various azo dyes including
   Reactive yellow 145, Reactive blue 222, Reactive red 43, Direct blue 21,
   and Acid blue 161, dye removal capability of 87.96-97.43% was obtained.
   The solution salinity showed positive effect on the biosorption process.
   The biomass pretreatment with calcium nitrate enhanced the removal
   capacity by 70.48% and the maximum reduction in dye removal (- 61%) was
   obtained when the fungal biomass was treated by sodium hydroxide.
   Biosorption kinetic follows the first-pseudo-order model, and the
   obtained data best fits both Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models.
   The maximum adsorption capacity of dried biomass for dye removal was
   58.48 mg g(-1). Based on FTIR, zeta potential value and pretreatment
   results, Yoshida H-binding, dipole-dipole H-binding, pi-pi and n-pi
   interactions were probably involved in the dye adsorption process. The
   results showed that biomass has a high potential for different dyes
   adsorption from real textile wastewater. The present study declares the
   high potential of Sarocladium sp. dried biomass as an effective and
   inexpensive biosorbent which can be used for bio-treatment of effluents
   with multi-dyes.

AB A Cu-Fe bimetallic-poly acrylic acid-grafted polytetrafluoroethylene
   (PTFE) fiber complex (Cu-Fe-PAA-g-PTFE) was prepared as an effective
   heterogeneous photo-Fenton catalyst for oxidative treatment and
   recycling of acid dye effluents from dyeing of wool fabric. Important
   factors affecting acid dye degradation, namely catalyst loading, H2O2
   concentration, solution pH, and dye concentration, were examined to
   optimize the photo-Fenton process conditions for the treatment of acidic
   dyeing effluents. Three acid dyes were used for the coloration of wool
   fabrics by a regular exhaustion process. The resulting wool-dyeing
   effluents were then treated using the optimized photo-Fenton process.
   The impact of recycling on the quality of the dyed wool fabric was also
   investigated. A photo-Fenton reaction system consisting of
   Cu-Fe-PAA-g-PTFE and H2O2 successfully degraded the acid dyes in water.
   Complete decoloration and a relatively high TOC (total organic carbon)
   removal percentage were achieved in 4.0 h under ultraviolet radiation
   for real wool-dyeing effluents when 7.0 g/l Cu-FePAA-g-PTFE and 7.0
   mmol/l H2O2 were used. The number of recycled effluents was found to be
   highly determined by their quality and dyeing properties of the acid
   dyes used. The dyeing quality was not affected for three successive
   cycles. However, lighter shades, significant color differences, and
   deteriorated fastness were observed for dyed wool fabrics in the fourth
   dyeing cycle, possibly because of an increase in the residual TOC value
   of the renovated effluents. Further TOC reduction of the treated
   effluents is therefore needed for their repeated reuse in more than
   three dyeing cycles.

AB This study investigated the removal of dissolved organic matter (DOM)
   from real dyeing bio-treatment effluents (DBEs) with the use of a novel
   magnetic anion exchange resin (NDMP). DOMs in two typical DBEs were
   fractionized using DAX-8/XAD-4 resin and ultrafiltration membranes. The
   hydrophilic fractions and the low molecular weight (MW) (<3 kDa) DOM
   fractions constituted a major portion (>50%) of DOMs for the two
   effluents. The hydrophilic and low MW fractions of both effluents were
   the greatest contributors of specific UV254 absorbance (SUVA(254)), and
   the SUVA(254) of DOM fractions decreased with hydrophobicity and MW. Two
   DBEs exhibited acute and chronic biotoxicities. Both acute and chronic
   toxicities of DOM fractions increased linearly with the increase of
   SUVA(254) value. Kinetics of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal via
   NDMP treatment was performed by comparing it with that of particle
   active carbon (PAC). Results indicated that the removal of DOC from DBEs
   via NDMP was 60%, whereas DOC removals by PAC were lower than 15%.
   Acidic organics could be significantly removed with the use of NDMP. DOM
   with large MW in DBE could be removed significantly by using the same
   means. Removal efficiency of NDMP for DOM decreased with the decrease of
   MW. Compared with PAC, NDMP could significantly reduce the acute and
   chronic bio-toxicities of DBEs. NaCl/NaOH mixture regenerants, with
   selected concentrations of 10% NaCl (m/m)/1% NaOH (m/m), could improve
   desorption efficiency. (C) 2014 The Research Center for

AB This work involved the preparation, characterization and dyes removal
   ability of Zn-Al, Mg-Al and Ni-Al layered double hydroxide (LDH)
   minerals intercalated by chloride ions. The materials were synthetized
   by the co-precipitation method. X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform
   infrared, thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis and
   transmission electron microscopy characterization exhibited a typical
   hydrotalcite structure for all the samples. Adsorption experiments for
   methyl orange were performed in terms of solution pH, contact time and
   initial dye concentration. Experimental results indicate that the
   capacity of dye uptake augmented rapidly within the first 60 min and
   then stayed practically the same regardless of the concentration.
   Maximum adsorption occurred with acidic pH medium. Kinetic data were
   studied using pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order kinetic models.
   Suitable correlation was acquired with the pseudo-second-order kinetic
   model. Equilibrium data were fitted to Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm
   models. The maximum Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacities were 2,758,
   1,622 and 800 mg/g, respectively, for Zn-Al-Cl, Mg-Al-Cl and Ni-Al-Cl.
   The materials were later examined for the elimination of color and
   chemical oxygen demand (COD) from a real textile effluent wastewater.
   The results indicated that the suitable conditions for color and COD
   removal were acquired at pH of 5. The maximum COD removal efficiency
   from the effluent was noted as 92.84% for Zn-Al-Cl LDH.

   of the three individual dyes investigated indicates that all of them are

   determined to be 200 degrees C, 4.0 g, 15.0 min, 15.0 min and pH < 10,
   respectively. The Langmuir model is the best-fitted one for the

   ability under optimized conditions as 1667 mg kg(-1), 3333 mg kg(-1) and
   2500 mg kg(-1) for Dye 1, Dye 2 and Dye 3, respectively. All three dyes
   follow pseudo-second-order kinetics for their adsorption describing
   initial rate of adsorption in the order, Dye 1 approximate to Dye 2
   (10,000 mg kg(-1) min(-1)) > Dye 3 (3333 mg kg(-1) min(-1)), and
   further, real dye effluent containing each of the above dyes having
   calculated initial concentrations of 42 mg L-1 (Dye 1), 106 mg L-1 (Dye
   2) and 39 mg L-1 (Dye 3), shows, 87%, 86% and 45% removal efficiencies
   at their lambda(max) values with the treatment of burnt brick clay
   particles under optimized conditions. Desorption of the dyes from the

   this study. During the operating period, the average influent and
   effluent COD concentrations were 737.0mg/L and 15.6mg/L, the influent
   and effluent color were 750 times and 10 times, with the total HRT being
   43.3h. The average COD and color removal efficiency were 97.9% and
   98.7%, respectively. And the effluent COD and color satisfied the
   discharge standards (grade-1) of water pollutants for dyeing and
   finishing of textile industry (China). In the operating conditions, HRT
   of O-3-BAF was decreased, leading to an increase of the effluent COD
   concentration. In addition, under the facultative circumstance by micro
   aeration in the FCR, where the dissolved oxygen (DO) was maintained in
   the range of 0.1-0.3mg/L, the growth of sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB)
   was inhibited. This study is a significant attempt to apply the combined
   process of FCR-BCO-O-3-BAF to textile wastewater treatment.

   TiO2 and UV radiation. Among effective parameters on the photocatalytic
   process, effects of three operational parameters (TiO2 concentration,
   initial pH and aeration flow rate) were examined with response surface
   methodology. The F-value (136.75) and p-value < 0.0001 imply that the
   model is significant. The 'Pred R-Squared' of 0.95 is in reasonable
   agreement with the 'Adj R-Squared' of 0.98, which confirms the
   adaptability of this model. From the quadratic models developed for
   degradation and subsequent analysis of variance (ANOVA) test using
   Design Expert software, the concentration of catalyst was found to be
   the most influential factor, while all the other factors were also
   significant. To achieve maximum dye removal, optimum conditions were
   found at TiO2 concentration of 3 g L-1, initial pH of 7 and aeration
   flow rate of 1.50 L min(-1). Under the conditions stated, the
   percentages of dye and chemical oxygen demand removal were 98.50% and
   91.50%, respectively. Furthermore, the mineralization test showed that
   total organic compounds removal was 91.50% during optimum conditions.

AB The rapid development of dye using industries (textile, paper, plastic,
   leather, printing, cosmetic, food and pharmaceuticals etc.), poor
   effluent management and disposal techniques have led to excess amounts
   of wastewater polluted with toxic dyes and heavy metal ions. The
   discharge of large volumes of toxic wastewater into the environment,
   particularly from small scale industries, causes extensive damage to
   natural ecosystems and human health. Therefore, the removal of these
   hazardous pollutants from effluents is of interest prior to release into
   natural water bodies. Micellar enhanced ultrafiltration (MEUF) shows a
   great potential as an effective, environmentally-friendly and
   sustainable operation in treatment of dye wastewater, particularly for
   diluted stream, for water reclamation and resource recovery. MEUF has
   been successfully investigated for removal organic dyes and heavy metal
   ions from aqueous solution, in single or binary system. In this review,
   we aim to provide an overview of the recent development, state-ofthe-art
   and future perspectives of MEUF for treatment of dye wastewater. This
   article critically reviews the performance and capability of MEUF
   process in the treatment of dye wastewater with the consideration of the
   basic principles, transport modelling, membrane fouling, technical
   viability, and parameters affecting micellization, optimization of feed,
   process throughput and removal efficiency. The effects of type of
   surfactants, membranes, initial feed concentrations, operating
   conditions etc. on the process performance are reviewed. This review
   presents the evidence of simultaneous removal of co-existing pollutants
   (dyes and heavy metal ions) in dye wastewater using MEUF and also
   explores the feasibility and efficiency of biosurfactant instead of
   chemical surfactant. Besides, several ways to improve process efficiency

AB Surfactant modified smectite was prepared using
   hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide at three cation exchange capacity
   (CEC) levels. Obtained organosmectites labeled H-i-Sm (I = 1, 2 and 3
   CEC) were characterized by several methods. Results show that the point
   of zero charge (PZC) of organo-modified smectite was displaced to the
   basic zone compared to that of Na-smectite. Hybrid material develops
   more positives surface charges, a heterogeneous structure with a great
   basal spacing layer. H-3-Sm and purified smectite (Arp) were then tested
   as adsorbents for the removal of an anionic diazo dye. Amount of dye
   removal by H-3-Sm (100%) was found to be around similar to 3 times
   higher than that of Arp. Complexe organosmectite after Congo Red (CR)
   dye adsorption can be used in photocatalytic field. The treated textile
   effluent by Arp, collected from textile Tunisian industry, can be
   re-used for vegetation irrigation, adapted to high salinity

AB The discharge of textile wastewater containing dye in the environment is
   varying for both toxicology and esthetical reasons as dyes impede light
   penetration, damage the quality of the receiving streams. Upflow
   anaerobic sludge blanket reactor with anaerobic digester sludge treating
   starch wastewater has been used to investigate the removal efficiency of
   chemical oxygen demand (COD) and colour of textile dye wastewater. In
   this study, the starch and textile dye wastewater was mixed at 70 and
   30%, respectively, and the experiments were carried out with recycle of
   treated wastewater at different percentage as 10, 20, 30 and 40. Maximum
   removal of COD and colour was 96% and 93.3%, respectively, at 30%
   recycle. At various OLR and HRT, the maximum removal of COD, colour was
   95.9%, 93% at 6.81 kg COD/m(3)d and 96%, 93% with 24 h of HRT. The
   maximum production of biogas at 24 h of HRT with 30% recycle was about
   355 l/d. The Volatile fatty acid/Alkalinity ratio of methanogenic
   reactor was found to be 0.049-0.053. The result provided evidence, the
   starch and dye wastewater have wide variation in their characteristics
   was treated on combination, this new technology supports the effective
   utilization of starch waste in destruction of dye.

AB Colored effluents containing dyes from various industries pollute the
   environment and pose problems in municipal wastewater treatment systems.
   Industrial effluents consist of a mixture of dyes and require study of
   the simultaneous removal of dyes. Simultaneous quantification of dyes in
   the solution is a common problem while using a spectrophotometric method
   due to overlapping of their absorption spectra. Derivative spectroscopy
   and chemometric methods in spectrophotometric analysis facilitate
   simultaneous quantification of dyes. Adsorption is a widely used
   treatment method for the removal of a mixture of recalcitrant dyes in
   industrial wastewaters. Confirming the assertion, this paper presents a
   state-of-the-art review on methods used for simultaneous quantification
   of dyes and the effects of various parameters on their adsorptive
   removal. This paper also reviews the adsorption equilibrium, modeling,
   mechanisms of dyes adsorption, and adsorbent regeneration techniques in
   multicomponent dye systems. It has been observed that chemometric
   techniques provide accuracy, repeatability, and high speed in processing
   and helps in better operability in real wastewater treatment plants. The
   conclusions include the need for the development of thermodynamic models
   that can predict simultaneous physisorption and chemisorption exhibited
   by different dyes and to develop isotherm models that can describe
   chemisorption of a mixture of dyes. The paper delves into inadequately
   researched gray areas of adsorption of a mixture of dyes which require
   the development of modified adsorption methods that serves process
   intensification for complete degradation/mineralization.

   Klebsiella sp. already adapted to 50 mg/L of congo red, and nano
   zerovalent iron (synthesized using pomegranate peels extract) were
   immobilized in sodium alginate to prepare the nano-biocomposite beads
   (NB beads).The NB beads were successfully applied for congo red removal
   from the aqueous solutions in batch reactor, and the experimental
   factors like dye concentration, bead weight, pH, and interaction time
   were optimized. Using the optimized conditions (congo red concentration
   50 mg/L; pH 5.0; NB beads weight 20% w/v; interaction time 180
   min),97.53 +/- 0.4%, and 126 +/- 1.2 mg/g removal (%) and removal
   capacity was obtained. The reaction kinetics followed pseudo-first order
   model. Real life applications of the nano bio composite beads were
   established with congo red-spiked tap water, groundwater and lake water
   samples with 95.82 +/- 0.3%, 95.88 +/- 0.6% and 95.53 +/- 0.4% removal
   respectively. After the treatment, the effluent solution showed
   significantly less toxicity towards environmental bacteria and algae
   than the untreated dye solutions. This proves that the novel nano-bio
   composite was successful in achieving dye removal with consequent
   detoxification.

AB The paper investigates the potential use of nano zero-valent iron (nZVI)
   particles as a cheap, natural and effective catalyst in the Fenton-like
   system for the removal of water-based Magenta flexographic dye from
   aqueous solution. The functional nZVI was successfully synthesized
   within an environmentally friendly method, by using the natural product
   extract, oak leaves (OAK-nZVI). The process of Magenta removal was
   optimized using statistically designed experiment. The influence of four
   quantitative parameters on decolorization efficiency was investigated:
   initial dye concentration (20-180 mgL(-1)), OAKnZVI dosage (0.75-60
   mgL(-1)), H2O2 concentration (1-11 mM) and pH value (2-10). The results
   of statistical analysis show that OAK-nZVI dosage and pH significantly
   contribute to the decolorization efficiency, while the concentration of
   H2O2 has a significant influence on their impact. The optimization
   yielded highest removal efficiency of 91.95% under following conditions:
   initial dye concentration of 180 mgL(-1), OAK-nZVI dosage of 60 mgrl,
   H2O2 concentration of 11 mM and pH value 2. Optimization results were
   experimentally verified. Treatment of real effluent under optimized
   experimental conditions resulted within 84.06% Magenta removal after a
   reaction time of 60 min. The absorption spectra of Magenta dye clearly
   indicate the changes in the molecular structure in the form of the
   destruction of azo bond in the chromophore, leading to the
   decolorization of dye solution. Based on the GC MS analysis, the
   mechanism for Fenton-like oxidation of Magenta was proposed. (C) 2018

AB An anoxic fixed film bioreactor (FFB) with biomass immobilized on
   activated carbon and an aerobic continuous stirred tank bioreactor with
   overflow were applied to degrade concentrate from nanofiltration of real
   textile effluents containing Reactive Red 120 (RR-120). The efficiency
   of color removal was 99 % irrespective of the fraction of nanofiltration
   concentrate in the feed. An approximate dye balance based on the
   assessed adsorption capacity of RR-120 by activated carbon indicated
   that the dye was removed by means of adsorption as well as of biological
   processes. Aromatic amine released from a dye molecule was fully
   adsorbed by activated carbon. COD level in the outflow of the system was
   above that imposed by legislation. Despite an adjustment of the feed pH
   to 7 this was constantly increasing up to the value above 9 in both
   reactors. Neither the nanofiltration concentrate nor the effluents from
   the bioreactors affected the growth of Pseudomonas putida used as
   toxicity indicator.

AB When dissolved calcium salts are reacted in aqueous medium in the
   presence of phosphate anions, a gelatinous precipitate forms. Maturation
   of this precipitate eventually leads to the formation of hydroxyapatites
   (HA). HA is a stable solid with high specific surface area, and
   interesting adsorption properties. Thermal treatment at 800 degrees C
   eliminates adsorbed organic matter and generates crystalline HA. Such HA
   can be recovered and reused by dissolution in acidic water. We have
   experimented with recycled HA the co-precipitation of textile dyes, and
   found that HA can be reused many times without loss of activity.
   However, in the case of blue dyes containing cupric ions, the metal ions
   remain in the solid phase following calcinations and the reactivity
   decreases slightly. In most cases, a very high level of dye removal was
   observed (above 98%), with little loss of recycled HA (12%). This makes
   the dye remediation process by HA co-precipitation economical and
   durable. Laboratory tests with a real industrial effluent showed a
   linear relationship between absorbance abatement and introduced calcium
   concentration, indicating the feasibility of the process.

AB Approximately, 15% of the total textile colorant production is estimated
   to be lost during dyeing and processing of textile fibres. If left
   untreated, these wastewaters can represent a serious environmental
   threat. In the present paper a combination of photocatalytic and
   biological degradation of prepared textile wastewaters (simulation of
   real textile effluent) is presented. Samples have been monitored through
   the course of photocatalytic experiments: change in UV-VIS absorbance
   spectra and complete decolouration were achieved for all three tested
   dyed wastewaters; however, only partial COD removal was achieved with
   photocatalytic oxidation (PCOx) and photocatalytic ozonation (PCOz).
   Toxicity test (Vibrio fischeri) of untreated and pretreated (constructed
   wetland, CW) samples showed a decrease in toxicity values only for the
   red-dyed wastewater. Comparison of efficiency of PCOx and PCOz for
   decolouration and mineralization of three structurally different dyes
   (anthraquinone and two azo dyes) has been done. CW pretreatment caused
   faster decolouration and substantial COD removal in PCOx (up to 45%).
   Pretreatment also accelerated decolouration during PCOz, but it
   accelerated COD removal only in the case of red-dyed wastewater due to
   short irradiation times applied.

AB The electrochemical degradation of a real textile effluent was carried
   out using Ti-Pt/beta-PbO2 and Ti/Ti(0.7-)wRu(0.3)O(2) (DSA (R)) anodes
   in a filter-press flow cell, in the presence and absence of chloride
   ions, varying, the pH (3, 7, 11) and temperature (25 degrees C and 45
   degrees C) of the effluent, and monitoring the removal of its turbidity
   and chemical oxygen demand (COD). The best experimental conditions for
   turbidity and COD removal were attained in neutral and basic conditions,
   independently of temperature. Higher COD removal values were attained
   with the Ti-Pt/beta-PbO2 anode, as a consequence of its higher oxidation
   power; the electric charge applied per unit volume of effluent
   significantly decreased in the presence of chloride ions, when
   instantaneous current efficiencies as high as 0.5 were attained in the
   initial electrooxidation stages. Under these conditions, the electric
   energy consumption necessary to oxidize the real textile effluent was as
   low as 50 kW h m(-3). The use of chloride ions enabled higher COD
   removal efficiencies using the Ti-Pt/beta-PbO2 and DSA (R) anodes than a
   purely mass-transport controlled process due to indirect oxidation
   processes mediated by the active chloro species. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB This work focused on producing different graphene oxide (GO) samples for
   further application in the adsorptive removal of dyes from real textile
   wastewater. Among all conditions tested, the sample produced using KMnO4
   and no sonication bath exhibited the best performance. Before the
   experiments using wastewater, kinetics and equilibrium of adsorption
   studies were performed with Methylene Blue (MB) dye. Experimental data
   showed the isotherm fitted the Freundlich model, and kinetic results
   fitted the pseudo-second order model. Theoretical q(max) was 308.11
   mg.g(-1) and over 90% removal of MB was reached in approximately 5 min.
   Although GO has been widely applied to remove cationic and anionic dyes
   from water, not many studies have presented GO as an adsorbent for real
   textile wastewater treatment. In 30 min, GO removed nearly 85% of
   turbidity and over 60% of color from a real sample, indicating that GO
   might be an excellent alternative to treat textile wastewater.

   peroxide at the PAN (polyacrylonitrile) based activated carbon fiber
   cloth cathode. A systematic study of COD removal percentage was carried
   Out at different oxygen sparging rates, applied current densities, Fe2+
   concentrations, solution pHs and temperatures The electro-Fenton
   technology can Successfully remove COD from the complex real dyeing
   wastewater Over 70% of COD can be removed after 240 min of treatment.
   The COD removal efficiency increased significantly with the oxygen
   sparging rates up to 150 cm(3)/min. The highest COD removal efficiency,
   75.2%, was achieved at an applied Current density of 3.2 mA/cm(2): COD
   removal efficiency deteriorated at higher current densities because the
   rates of side reactions increased. The results showed that the optimal
   Solution pH was 3 Increasing the solution pH rapidly decreased COD
   removal efficiency Conversely. COD removal efficiency increased with
   increasing Fe2+ concentrations up to 2 mM Temperature had a slightly
   negative effect on COD removal efficiency (C) 2009 Elsevier B V. All

AB Pods of the forest speciesCaesalpinia echinatawere used as an
   alternative adsorbent to remove bright blue (BB) and methylene blue (MB)
   dyes. The raw and acid-treated samples were characterized by techniques
   like SEM, XRD, and FTIR. The acid-treated pod sample was characterized
   by an amorphous structure containing several cavities, bumps, and
   functional groups. The Elovich model was the most satisfactory to
   describe the adsorption kinetic data. The isothermal studies were better
   described by the Langmuir model for BB dye, with a maximum capacity of
   261 mg g(-1), and Toth model for MB dye, giving a maximum capacity of
   288 mg g(-1). The thermodynamic study indicated a spontaneous and
   favorable process and endothermic nature for both dyes. In the treatment
   of two simulated effluents containing a mixture of different compounds
   such as dyes and salts, to simulate real wastewaters, the adsorbent was
   highly efficient, presenting around 80% of color removal for both
   effluents. Therefore, the acid-treated pods ofCaesalpinia echinatahave
   great potential to be applied as an alternative adsorbents in treating
   colored effluents in discontinuous systems.

AB The aim of this study is the removal and recovery of methylene blue (MB)
   from wastewater. MB is one of the most commonly used substances for
   dyeing cotton, wood, and silk. Though MB is not strongly hazardous, it
   can cause some harmful effects where acute exposure to MB may cause
   increased heart rate, vomiting, shock, cyanosis, jaundice and
   quadriplegia and tissue necrosis in human. So, we selected the MB for
   solvent/liquid-liquid extraction study. MB is the cationic dye, so it
   requires an anionic carrier for extraction purpose. Salicylic acid acts
   as an anionic carrier in this study. Removal of MB using salicylic acid
   in benzene was studied. The efficiency of dye extraction increased with
   decreasing dye concentration. The extracted dye in the organic phase can
   be back-extracted into 1M oxalic acid solutions. The experimental
   parameters examined were salicylic acid concentration, effects of
   diluents, effect of pH, effect of initial dye concentration, effect of
   equilibrium time, aqueous to organic phase ratio, and various stripping
   agents. Real effluent was also studied under optimized condition and
   satisfactory result has been found.

AB Wastewater treatment is a crucial issue in the textile industry.
   Numerous novel technologies and processes have been developed to improve
   the efficiency and effectiveness of wastewater reclamation in wastewater
   treatment plants. The present chapter focuses on catalytic ozonation
   facilitated by carbon aerogel materials for on-site real textile dyeing
   wastewater treatment rather than a bench-scale study. A primary
   industrial trial in a dyeing wastewater treatment plant is reported to
   have validated the effectiveness and efficiency of catalytic ozonation
   technology in the reclamation of real textile wastewater. The industrial
   trial was carried out in an integrated treatment system comprising a
   catalytic ozonation reactor, a 3D electrolysis reactor, a membrane
   bioreactor, and a reverse osmosis unit for the comprehensive treatment
   of real wastewater. The water quality of effluents from each treatment
   unit was monitored and compared to industrial criteria for the reuse of
   wastewater.

AB Simultaneous decolorization and mineralization of high concentrations of
   methyl orange (MO) by mixed microbial culture via denitrification
   pathway was studied in a 1.5 L capacity anoxic up-flow packed bed
   reactor. Feasibility of dye degradation at varying concentrations of MO,
   sucrose, and NO3--N were studied with varied hydraulic retention time
   (HRT). The mixed microbial culture procured from a sequencing batch
   reactor treating domestic sewage exhibited a high affinity for
   decolorization/mineralization of MO up to 500 mg/L. Optimum removal of
   97 % of color, 88 % of TN, 86 % of COD, and 83 % of TOC was observed at
   HRT of 12 h. Decolorization followed a first-order kinetics with rate
   constant of 0.1/h. The presence of sucrose and NO3-N at optimal
   concentrations significantly enhanced MO decolorization/mineralization.
   The optimal COD/NO3 -N ratio for effective simultaneous decolorization
   and mineralization of 500 mg/L MO at 12 h HRT was 48. UV-vis absorption
   spectra of effluent and TOC data indicate effective decolorization and
   mineralization of dye, respectively. Hence the developed process shows
   the potential of simultaneous removal of color, COD/TOC, and TN
   effectively in a single reactor. However, further research is required
   to explore the application of this process in treating real textile dye
   effluent having mixed dyes.

   electrolytic cell equipped with stainless steel anode and graphite

   effects of various operational parameters such as initial solution pH,
   NaS concentration, MnS concentration, ultrasound power and voltage on
   the sono-electro-chemical treatment were investigated. The results have
   demonstrated that the enhanced colour removal efficiency was achieved at
   pH 2 for electro-chemical process; however, better efficiency was
   reached by synergistic effect of sono-electro-chemical treatment in the
   presence of less amount of electrolytes with the short reaction time
   than the individual sono-chemical and electro-chemical process. The
   maximum decolourization achieved was 89% under the condition: 100 ppm
   RB5, 50 ppm NaS, 75 ppm MnS, solution pH and 44 W ultrasound power, 20
   V. When the similar methodology was adopted to real textile effluent,
   90% of TOC removal was observed and it indicates the employment of
   studied process for industrial wastewater treatment purposes.

AB Trichosporon akiyoshidainum HP2023 is a basidiomycetous yeast isolated
   from Las Yungas rainforest (Tucuman, Argentina) and selected based on
   its outstanding textile-dye-decolorizing ability. In this work, the
   decolorization process was optimized using Reactive Black 5 as dye
   model. Lactose and urea were chosen as carbon and nitrogen sources
   through a one-at-time approach. Afterwards, factorial designs were
   employed for medium optimization, leading to the formulation of a
   simpler optimized medium which contains in g L-1: lactose 10, yeast
   extract 1, urea 0.5, KH2PO4 1 and MgSO4 1. Temperature and agitation
   conditions were also optimized. The optimized medium and incubation
   conditions for dye removal were extrapolated to other dyes individually
   and a mixture of them. Dye removal process happened through both
   biosorption and biodegradation mechanisms, depending primarily on the
   dye structure. A positive relation between initial inoculum and dye
   removal rate and a negative relation between initial dye concentration
   and final dye removal percentages were found. Under optimized
   conditions, T. akiyoshidainum HP2023 was able to completely remove a
   mixture of dyes up to a concentration of 300 mg L-1, a concentration
   much higher than those expected in real effluents.

AB It is of great significance to study the treatment of organic dye
   pollution. In this work, a method of electrochemical treatment for
   reactive blue 19 dye (RB19) wastewater system was established, and it
   was applied to the actual dye wastewater treatment. The effects of
   applied voltage, electrolyte concentration, electrode spacing, and
   initial concentration on the removal effect of RB19 have been studied in
   detail. The results show that the removal rate of RB19 can reach 82.6%
   and the chemical oxygen demand (CODcr) removal rate is 54.3% under
   optimal conditions. The removal of RB19 in the system is mainly the
   oxidation of hydroxyl free radicals. The possible degradation pathway is
   inferred by ion chromatography: hydroxyl free radicals attack the
   chromophoric group of RB19 to make it fall off, and then decompose it
   into ring-opening. The product is finally oxidized to CO2 and water. The
   kinetic fitting is in accordance with the zero-order reaction kinetics.
   At the same time, using the established electrochemical system to treat
   the actual dye wastewater has also achieved good results. After 3 hours
   of treatment, the CODcr removal rate of the raw water is 44.8%, and the
   CODcr removal of the effluent can reach 89.5%. The degradation process
   conforms to the zero-order reaction kinetics. The result is consistent
   with the electrochemical treatment of RB19.

AB This paper deals with the efficiency of electrocoagulation (EC) for the
   abatement of COD, TOC, absorbance (i.e. color) and turbidity from a real
   textile wastewater, a pure red dye solution (disperse dyes 2-naphthoic
   acid and 2-naphthol) and a solution combining the two above fluids. The
   treatment of the dyestuff solution is satisfactory with high levels of
   color and organic pollution abatement. The treatment of the industrial
   waste is less efficient. Treatment of the solution combining the two
   above fluids allows to investigate whether the removal of several
   polluting matters by electrocoagulation could be considered as the
   superimposition of the various treatments of single-species effluents,
   in sort of additivity principle, as presented in an original model for
   the treatment of two-pollutant waste. Turbidity and TOC were shown to be
   additive variables in the treatment of the dye solution and the
   industrial textile waste: electrocoagulation seems to proceed with no
   interaction between the two types of matter to be removed, namely the
   dye stuff, and the lot of pollutants contained in the industrial waste.

AB Water pollution control is presently one of the most important areas for
   scientific research. Strict regulatory measures are asking industries to
   treat their waste effluents up to the standards set by the governing
   body. Color removal, in particular, has recently become an area of major
   scientific interest as indicated by many related research reports. The
   textile industries use huge amount of water in their various processes
   of dyeing and are thus one of the largest producers of industrial liquid
   waste (ILW). In this study TOC removal was evaluated by
   electro-coagulation using iron electrode from real textile dye waste and
   mathematical model was developed to predict TOC removal performance. The
   parameters that were taken into considerations were the effect of pH,
   time, current and initial TOC concentration. At optimum condition the
   removal was achieved as 95.7%.

AB Industrial textile generates large volumes of effluents which are
   heavily loaded with pollutants, turbidity and are highly concentrated in
   salts and color. A significant improvement in effluent quality is
   required before it is discharged into the environment. In the present
   work, performances of a combined process using chemical coagulation,
   ultrafiltration and nanofiltration were investigated in treating
   synthetic textile wastewater containing reactive dyes (Blue S-GLD 150
   dyes) and different salt concentration. The efficiency of the combined
   process was evaluated in terms of effluent decolourization and turbidity
   removal. Experimental results showed that the optimal dose of coagulant
   using aluminium sulphate was 1 g/L obtained at pH = 7. The decrease of
   the effluent salinity improved the treated water quality by increasing
   the removal of color and turbidity. To explain the effect of the
   salinity on the optimal coagulant dose, the zeta potential was used as a
   control parameter. When ultrafiltration (UF) or nanofiltration (NF) were
   used in post treatment to coagulation-flocculation, the stabilized
   permeate flux was higher for UF. It remained constant until a volumetric
   reduction factor (VRF) reaching 4 for NF and 6 for UF at 25 L/h.m(2) and
   122 L/h.m(2) respectively. The retention of color and salt were higher
   for NF than for UF. These results were similar for real and model
   effluent.

AB In this work, a real effluent discharged by Brazilian textile industry,
   has been electrochemically treated using boron doped diamond (BDD) anode
   for removing chemical oxygen demand (COD) and colour. Preliminary
   experiments were performed under real discharged effluent conditions (pH
   and conductivity) in order to verify the applicability of this treatment
   process. However, a partial elimination of COD and colour effluent were
   achieved, depending on applied current density (20, 40 and 60 mA
   cm(-2)), respectively. Therefore, different set of experiments were
   carried out where an amount Na2SO4 was added in the real effluent: then,
   COD of textile effluent was satisfactorily reduced by employing
   different operational conditions (current density, temperature, Na2SO4
   concentration, flow rate), reducing the time of depuration and
   consequently, the costs, confirming the potential efficiency of this
   textile effluent treatment. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The wastewater generated from textile industries is highly colored and
   contains dyes including azo dyes, which are toxic to human and
   water-living organisms. The treatment of these azo dyes using
   conventional treatment techniques is challenging due to their
   recalcitrant properties. In the current study, the effect of additional
   Fe2+ on electrocoagulation (EC) using Fe electrodes has been studied for
   the removal of methyl orange (MO) azo dye. pH between 4-5 was found to
   be optimum for EC and treatment efficiency decreased with increasing dye
   concentrations. With the addition of Fe2+ salt, dye removal for a
   certain concentration was increased with the increase of current density
   and Fe2+ up to a certain limit and after that, the removal efficiency
   decreased. The COD, color and dye removals were 88.5%, 93.1% and 100%,
   respectively, for EC of 200 mg.L-1 dye solution using only 0.20 mmol.L-1
   Fe2+ for 0.40 mA cm(-2) current density, whereas for EC, the respective
   removal efficiencies were 76.7%, 63.4% and 82.4% for 32 min. The
   respective operating cost for EC was $768 kg(-1) removed dye ($0.342
   m(-3)), whereas, for EC with additional Fe2+ salt, it was $350 kg(-1)
   removed dye ($0.189 m(-3)). The kinetic results revealed that the
   first-order kinetic model was fitted best for EC, whereas the
   second-order kinetic model was best fitted for Fe2+ added EC. For real
   textile wastewater, 57.6% COD removal was obtained for 0.15 mmol.L-1
   Fe2+ added EC compared to 27.8% COD removal for EC for 32 min. Based on
   the study we can conclude that Fe2+ assisted EC can be used for
   effective treatment of textile wastewater containing toxic compounds
   like azo dyes.

AB A new environmentally safe technology for the removal of dyes was
   evaluated. A new polymeric nanofiber with a natural carotenoid bixin was
   used as an adsorbent. The material was manufactured by the
   electrospinning technique. The behavior of bixin nanofiber in the
   sorption on dye compounds was studied by investigating the deposition
   time, area, medium pH, ionic strength, adsorption kinetics and
   adsorption isotherms. Removal greater than 96% and 70% for BG and MB,
   respectively, was obtained under the following conditions: dye solutions
   of 20.0 mg kg(-1), pH 6.00, and supporting area of 6.76 cm(-2) of the
   adsorbent material (80 min of deposition of nanofibers on each face).
   The kinetics presented the best fit to the pseudo-second order model.
   Dye recoveries using real water samples from taps and lakes, as well as
   from aquaculture industry were over 58% and 78% for MB and BG,
   respectively. Thus, polymeric bixin nanofibers are promising for
   application as dye remover for water remediation.

AB Adsorption of tartrazine yellow food dye, in a fixed-bed column, was
   carried out using a single system, a binary system (in the presence of
   sunset yellow food dye), and in a real effluent provides from an ice
   cream industry. Chitosan was used to coat sand particles by the
   dip-coating technique, and these particles were applied in fixed-bed
   adsorption. The assays were performed in flow rates of 3 mL min(-1)and 5
   mL min(-1). The best performance was reached at 3 mL min(-1). In this
   flow rate, for single and binary systems, the breakthrough time was 95
   min and 65 min, and the maximum capacity of the column was around 595 mg
   g(-1)and 497 mg g(-1), respectively. In the assay conducted with the
   real effluent, the breakthrough time was 10 min, and the maximum
   adsorption capacity of the column was reduced to 191 mg g(-1)for

AB The discharge volume and composition of textile effluents gain
   scientific concern due to hazardous and biotoxic nature of azo dyes. Azo
   dyes are non-biodegradable due to its complex molecular structure and
   recalcitrant nature. Serious attempts have been made to synthesize and
   develop new materials to combat the environmental problems. The present
   study is designed for removal of azo dyes (Methyl orange, Congo red and
   Basic fuchsine) from synthetic aqueous solutions and real textile
   effluents. For this purpose, cobalt-doped alumina hybrids are
   synthesized and applied as adsorbents in batch experiment. Two different
   aluminium precursor (aluminium nitrate and spent aluminium foil) and
   glucose are mixed following sol-gel method to get hybrids. The
   synthesized hybrids are characterized for surface and bulk properties
   using Fourier transform infrared, scanning electron microscopy and
   energy dispersive X-ray techniques. The characterization of materials
   under Fourier transform infrared revealed that -OH (3487-3504cm(-1)),
   C-H (2935-2985cm(-1)), Al-O-C (similar to 1380cm(-1)), Al-O (similar to
   800cm(-1)), Al-O-Al (659-669cm(-1)) and Co-O (583-589cm(-1)) groups
   participate in the binding of dyes onto the surface of hybrids.
   Amorphous shaped particles and elemental composition (carbon, aluminium
   and oxygen) are demonstrated in scanning electron microscopy-energy
   dispersive X-ray micrograph. Time-dependent batch experiments under
   identical experimental parameters showed 74% of basic fuchsine, 68% of
   methyl orange and 85% maximum removal of Congo red onto the surface of
   cobalt-doped alumina hybrids probably through ion exchange mechanism.
   The experimental data when treated with adsorption models and isotherms,
   pseudo-second-order kinetic and Freundlich isotherm are found to be best
   fitted. The present study accomplishes the successful synthesis of novel
   and efficient cobalt-doped alumina hybrids provides environmental
   friendly and economical alternative option to the commercial adsorbents
   for the treatment of textile effluents.

AB Combined coagulation and electrochemical treatment processes were used
   to mineralize the organic load and detoxify a real textile effluent. The
   coagulation step was investigated for distinct pH values (4 to 11) and
   Al-2(SO4)(3) concentrations (0.25 to 9.00 g L-1). Complete turbidity and
   partial total organic carbon (TOC) removals were attained at pH 5, using
   0.50 g L-1Al2(SO4)(3). Moreover, the coagulation process totally removed
   the initial toxicity (100 % mortality) of the effluent, assessed by
   toxicity tests with the crustacean Artemia salina. The remaining TOC was
   mineralized by the electrochemical step in a flow cell with a
   boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode, when the investigated parameters were
   the BDD boron-doping level (100, 500, 2500 ppm), pH (3, 7, 11, no
   control), and current density (10, 20, 30 mA cm(-2)). No significant
   differences in TOC removal were observed when the BDD anode or pH value
   was changed; however, as the system was under mass transport limitation,
   mineralization attained at low current densities led to a reasonable
   current efficiency (similar to 40 %) and low energy consumption (similar
   to 16 kW h m(-3)). The use of the electrochemical method solely led to
   poor TOC and turbidity removals, thus not being recommended.

AB In the present study, ettringite precipitation was theoretically and
   experimentally evaluated as a means of sulphate removal. The results
   showed that ettringite precipitation is an effective and reliable method
   for sulphate removal. Synthetically prepared samples which were
   simulated to total wastewaters originating from the textile industry
   (sulphate concentration of 0.06M) and to dye bath effluent (sulphate
   concentration of 0.22M) were subjected to ettringite precipitation using
   the systems with Na2SO4-AlCl3-Ca(OH)(2)-NaOH, Na2SO4-AlCl3-Ca(OH)(2),
   and Na2CO3-Na2SO4-AlCl3-Na(OH)(2). An equilibrium model involving
   precipitation more than one solid phase and with ionic strength
   correction was used to predict the sulphate removal efficiency as well
   as solution composition. The optimum pH for ettringite precipitation in
   all systems was found to be around 12.0. By the application of the
   method, 0.06M initial sulphate concentration was reduced down to 60mg/L
   for synthetically prepared samples and 325mg/L for real wastewater. For
   the concentrated samples of 0.22M initial sulphate, remaining sulphate
   levels varying between 230 and 280mg/L were obtained for both synthetic
   and real wastewater samples.

AB Gallinaceous feathers (from Gallus gallus domesticus, strains Cobb 500
   and Label) were used as adsorbent for colour removal from a simulated
   textile effluent containing a wool reactive dye, the Yellow Lanasol 4G
   (CI Reactive Yellow 39). A brief chemical and physical characterisation
   of feathers was performed. Equilibrium studies at different selected
   temperatures, in the range 10-60 degrees C, were carried out. The
   equilibrium data were analysed using the Freundlich and Langmuir
   isotherm models. Adsorption capacity strongly increases with
   temperature. A maximum adsorption capacity of around 300 mg g(-1) was
   obtained for Gallus gallus feathers, strain Cobb 500, at 60 degrees C,
   while for strain Label, 200 mg g(-1) was obtained at 50 degrees C. For
   each type of feather a generalised model, valid for a given temperature
   range, was obtained. The isosteric heat of adsorption calculated was
   positive, so the mechanism involved in the adsorption process should
   correspond to endothermic chemisorption. This study provides important
   information concerning the use of gallinaceous feathers without any
   chemical treatment for colour removal from real textile wastewaters. The
   results in this study indicated that gallinaceous feathers, when
   compared with activated carbon, open promising perspectives concerning
   their utilisation for colour removal from textile effluent discharged at
   high temperatures; moreover, it would be an alternative for the
   valorisation of this waste.

   initial dye concentration, solution pH, salinity and temperature on the

   dye degradation using both RSM (CCD) and ANN on a comparative scale, RSM
   was found to be a more suitable approach. Application of RSM optimised
   conditions resulted in 99.87, 98.74 and 97.57% decolorization of SA, CV
   and MB respectively. Effect of dye exposure on bacterial cells was
   investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The untreated and

   degradation. Phytotoxicity assay with Cicer arietinum showed that
   seedlings exposed to untreated effluents showed significantly impaired

   effluents which in turn were at par with control levels. The results

AB This paper deals with the methylene blue molecule (MB) removal from
   synthetic and real textile wastewaters by alkali-treated orange tree
   sawdust (ATOS) under different dynamic conditions. Experimental results
   showed that MB removal efficiencies by ATOS increased when increasing
   initial dye concentrations and bed depths but decreased with the
   increase of the applied flow rates with a maximum adsorption capacity of
   about 110 mg g(-1). Moreover, various empirical models were applied to
   predict the experimental breakthrough curves (BTCs) and to determine the
   characteristic adsorption parameters. The applied models successfully
   fitted data in the following order: Thomas ((R) over bar (2)(Th) =
   0.969), dose response ((R) over bar (2)(D-R) = 0.949), and Clark ( (R)
   over bar (2)(Clark) = 0.874). ATOS was also found to efficiently remove
   dyes and other mineral pollutants such as chlorides, nitrates, and
   phosphates from real wastewaters. MB removal by ATOS involved not only
   cationic exchange but also complexation with acidic and basic functional
   groups. Moreover, important MB desorption yields from ATOS (more than
   93%) were obtained when using saline solutions. All these results
   confirmed that NaOH-treated orange tree sawdust can be considered as a
   promising material for the removal of cationic dyes from industrial
   wastewaters.

AB In this work, the biosorption potential of agro-industrial wastes was
   assessed for the removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) from real
   textile effluents. The screening test conducted indicated that corncobs
   biomass has maximum potential among five agricultural waste materials
   (sugarcane bagasse, peanut husk, corncobs, cotton sticks, and sunflower)
   to remove COD from both textile effluents. The effect of important
   operating parameters like biosorbent dose, agitation time, agitation
   speed, and temperature was evaluated during the study. The maximum COD
   removal (80.8 and 72.4% for Effluents 1 and 2, respectively) was
   achieved at 0.5 g biosorbent dose and 140 rpm agitation speed. The
   biosorption process was found to be exothermic in nature. The data were
   also subjected to different kinetic and equilibrium models and the
   results depicted the fitness of pseudo-second-order kinetic model and
   Langmuir adsorption isotherm on the experimental data. The
   physicochemical characteristics (pH, electrical conductivity, COD, total
   dissolved solids, and TDS) of textile effluents were also evaluated
   before and after the treatment. The FT-IR spectrum of corncobs biomass
   indicates the involvement of carboxylic, carbonyl, and hydroxyl group in
   the adsorption process. The results indicated that corncobs biomass is a
   potential and cost-effective biomass for the treatment of real textile
   effluents.

AB A novel set up composed of an anaerobic biofilm reactor followed by
   ozonation was used for treatment of artificial and real textile
   effluents containing azo dyes. The biological treatment efficiently
   removed chemical oxygen demand and color. Ozonation further reduced the
   organic content of the effluents and was very important for the
   degradation of aromatic compounds, as shown by the reduction of UV
   absorbance. The acute toxicity toward Vibrio fischeri and the shrimp
   Anemia sauna increased after the biological treatment. No toxicity was
   detected after zonation with the exception of the synthetic effluent
   containing the highest concentration, 1 g/l, of the azo dye Remazol Red.
   Both untreated and biologically treated textile effluents were found to
   have mutagenic effects. The mutagenicity increased even further after 1
   min of ozonation. No mutagenicity was however detected in the effluents
   subjected to longer exposure to ozone.
   The results of this study suggest that the use of ozonation as short
   post-treatment after a biological process can be beneficial for the
   degradation of recalcitrant compounds and the removal of toxicity of
   textile wastewater. However, monitoring of toxicity and especially
   mutagenicity is crucial and should always be used to assess the success
   of a treatment strategy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   problems, if disposed of without any prior treatment. Therefore, the
   treatment of these textile effluents is necessary. The present study
   aims to investigate the removal efficiency of colors from wastewater
   containing mixed primary direct dyes and real textile industry
   wastewater using PDS (Peroxydisulfate)/Fe(II)/UV process. A simulated
   mixture, based on an industrial recipe and containing Reactive Yellow 17
   (RY17), Reactive Red 120 (RR120), and Reactive Blue 19 (RB19), was
   investigated. The obtained results showed that the mineralization rate
   is around 96.1% for RY17, 99.2% for RR120, 100% for RB19 and 80% for
   their mixed during 2 h of the treatment. The degradation of real textile
   wastewater was about 66% under similar conditions. The evaluations
   showed that similar to 93.82 MAD/m(3) (similar to 8.64 EURO/m(3)) is
   needed to supply the operating cost. As a vital industrial criterion, it
   was estimated that the conditions of initial pH of 3, [PDS] = 1 mM and T
   = 25 degrees C the highest cost effective case of the process for
   degrading the mixed dyes. Phytotoxicity studies revealed that the
   degradation products of mixed dyes and textile effluent were scarcely
   toxic in nature, thereby increasing the applicability of PDS/Fe(II)/UV
   for the treatment of textile wastewater. This will open a perspective
   for the reuse of treated water in crop irrigation. Based on the results
   of the advanced oxidation technologies experiments, it was found that
   PDS/Fe(II)/UV is the best treatment method for real textile wastewater.

AB The algae bloom phenomenon incurs a major challenge to conventional
   drinking water treatment processes due to the discharges of a large
   amount of intracellular pollutant and odor compounds in the water
   sources. Membrane processes have been considered as promising
   technologies to treatment of algal-rich water due to complete algal cell
   rejection however, its application has been limited by membrane fouling.
   In this work, the high-performance loose antifouling PES NF membranes
   were fabricated using diazonium-induced grafting and applied for
   treating real algal effluent. The modified membranes exhibited complete
   algal dye removal and turbidity removal throughout the long-term
   filtration. Also, the coupling and radically modified membranes can be
   able to removed COD by up to 90% and 88%, respectively, while a removal
   efficiency of 24% was observed for bare membrane. It is worth noting
   that, a relative smooth behavior in permeate flux by loose modified
   membranes during prolonged algal dye filtration, demonstrating
   exceptional anti-fouling property of membranes. In addition, the fouled
   modified membranes were effectively recovered by water flushing. Both
   loose modified membranes exhibited excellent resistance in the strongly
   acidic environment. These high performance antifouling NF membranes
   affords an innovative methodology toward the treatment of algal-rich
   water.

AB Recent research has focused on the synthesis and application of
   filtration sieves which facilitate fast solute separation during
   processes of desalination and wastewater treatment. This study reports a
   simple method for fabrication of Graphene oxide (GO)- nanobentonite (NB)
   filtration sieves with polyethylene glycol (PEG) interlinkage for
   efficient removal of mixed cationic dyes and electrolytes from their
   aqueous solutions. The GO-PEG-NB sieves were characterized for
   morphology, structural stability and vacuum filtration performance.
   Insertion of PEG linked NB particles between GO sheets was found to
   increase capillary size of the former and resist intercalation effects
   of cations present in effluent. Vacuum filtration processes carried out
   at moderate pressure (0.7 kg cm(-2)) had resulted in simultaneous
   removal of similar to 99% of 30 mg L-1 of ternary dyes and 40 g L-1 of
   mixed electrolytes with an optimum flux of 5.74 +/- 0.62 L-1 m(-2)
   h(-1). The GO-PEG-NB sieves offered good stability and efficient cation
   removal and therefore exhibited immense potential for treatment of wide
   scale real-time wastewaters.

AB A novel adsorbent-based coating with zwitterionic functionality (ZwitAd)
   was employed to treat the heavily polluted hand-drawn batik industrial
   effluent. The adsorbent was prepared as a coating and supported onto a
   cotton cloth by applying a simple preparation method based on the
   combined use of clay-based adsorbent, polymer-based binder, and cationic
   polyelectrolyte. Batik effluent which is known to have high chemical
   oxygen demand (COD) (412-2205 mg/L) and colour intensity (500-16900
   ADMI) has undertaken treatment process using ZwitAd. The results showed
   a significant reduction of COD (147 mg/L), colour (128 ADMI), and pH
   (7.34), which complied with the standard discharge limit for industrial
   effluent regulations. The finding proved that ZwitAd is applicable to
   reduce the COD and colour intensity and stabilise the pH of water. This
   new innovative treatment has simultaneously improved the effluent
   conditions and minimised operational costs, and minimum secondary waste
   is generated. The proposed application of ZwitAd at an industrial scale
   has also been introduced as a functional industrial storage tank with a
   feasible and practical operation.

   retention efficiency of textile wastewater (TOV) with commercial
   ultrafiltration (UF) membranes (GH, GK, PT, PU, PW, MW) with a wide
   range of molecular weight cut-off (MWCO), 2-50 kDa. The tested UF
   membranes resulted in a reduction in colour and colour intensity from
   56.35 % to 97.93 %. Membrane of lower MWCO values (below 3 kDa) may be
   suitable for removing dyes from the real TOV sample.

AB Uncontrolled volumes of textile effluents (TE) discharged into
   water-bodies significantly escalate the possibility of health hazards
   and environmental deterioration owing to the presence of hazardous dye
   contaminants. In this work, the toxic components in real TE were sensed
   on a graphene boosted silver nanoparticles (Ag-rGO) platform through
   surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) technique. Transmission
   electron microscopic images of Ag-rGO showed spherical Ag nanoparticles
   of similar to 8 nm dispersed on wrinkled graphene oxide sheets. The
   efficiency of the substrate as a SERS sensor and photocatalytic
   substrate was first analyzed on commercial dyes such as rhodamine6 G,
   Congo red and malachite green. In TE, carcinogenic azo dye contaminants
   were effectively identified from the presence of N=N and C-N bands
   present in the SERS spectra. Further, removal of these dye contaminants
   in TE through visible light assisted photocatalysis by Ag-rGO was also
   evaluated. High degradation rate constant of similar to 9 x 10(-3)/min
   was observed in TE after visible light assisted photocatalysis by
   Ag-rGO. Synergistically, the dual utility of Ag-rGO can be attributed to
   the enhanced electromagnetic field originating from the plasmonic nature
   of Ag nanoparticles and the strengthened charge transfer due to the
   adsorptive nature of rGO. Furthermore, the reduced particle size and
   suppressed fluorescence also aids the sensing and removal. These results
   suggest feasible development of sensitive, scalable, stable intermediate
   dye sensing and removal/water recycling structures based on Ag-rGO to be
   incorporated at the discharge stage of textile dyeing industries.

AB Numerous strategies on the application of superwettable membranes for
   oil/water (O/W) separation have been proposed; however, few works on
   one-step separation strategies and the separation mechanism of complex
   O/W effluents containing organic dye and bacteria have been reported.
   Here, an integrated strategy for O/W separation, removal, and
   anti-oil/bacteria/dye-fouling is firstly proposed. A hydrogel fabricated
   PVDF@ZnO/Ag (HPVDF@ZnO/Ag) membrane is designed with a
   superhydrophilic/underwater superoleophobic surface and hierarchical
   membrane channels, which exhibits superior separation efficiency (99.4%)
   and flux (1700 L m- 2 h-1 bar-1). Considering the wettability, the
   interface intrusion pressure influences the O/W separation. Also
   considering the energy and molecular kinetics, the differences in the
   interaction energy and mean square displacement (MSD) of the water and
   oil molecules with the membrane obtained by molecular dynamics (MD)
   simulations are the internal factors influencing the O/W separation. The
   experimental and MD simulation results demonstrate that the high organic
   dye removal efficiency (>99%) is attributed to the synergistic effect
   between the hydrogel electrostatic adsorption and the ZnO/Ag
   photodegradation. The excellent anti-oil/dye/bacteriafouling is due to
   the low oil adhesion, hydration layer, photodegradation, and
   antibacterial activity. Introducing an amino resin to the membrane
   increases the membrane?s tolerance and resistance to mechanical damage
   and chemical attack due to the intertwined cross-linking network and
   hydrogen bonds. The membrane also exhibits effective separation of real
   wastewater from jeans factory. This strategy may inspire further
   research on the treatment of complex O/W effluents.

AB The present study deals with the treatment of real effluents, containing
   a mixture of reactive dyes (mainly methylene blue), by
   electrocoagulation (EC) coupled with electrochemical advanced oxidation
   processes (EAOPs) such as peroxi-coagulation (PC), anodic oxidation
   (AO), and electro-Fenton (EF), individually. To choose the right
   treatment process, the key criteria should be higher degradation
   efficiency and minimal energy consumption. Textile effluents are
   physico-chemical characterized and the operating parameters i.e. the
   initial pH, the current density, and the electrolysis time, were
   investigated. Wastewater treatment energy consumption was evaluated for
   each combined process. The results highlighted high efficiency of
   electrochemical processes in effective degradation of organic pollutants
   at the optimum operating conditions. Among the electrochemical advanced
   oxidation processes tested, sequential EC-EF treatment was being
   preferred and quite effective since it provided electro generated
   hydroxyl radical (OH)-O-center dot especially when using the boron-doped
   diamond. Thus, removals of 97%, 100% and 100% for, respectively, TOC,
   turbidity and color removal were achieved by using the EC-EF combined
   process. Energy consumption values were evaluated for textile dye
   decolorization as 0.45-1.5 kWh kg(-1) of the removed TOC, depending on
   the applied current density. Regarding the efficiency level and the
   operating cost, the EC-EF combined process offers many advantages
   allowing the reuse of the treated water for other purposes.

AB Graphene oxide quantum dots (GOQDs) were used as photocatalysts under
   visible light for the discoloration of synthetic and real wastewater
   spiked with organic azo dye. The GOQDs were synthesized using a one-pot
   method involving the pyrolysis of citric acid. The characterization of
   the synthesized GOQDs using XPS, FTIR, XRD, Raman, UV-Vis, FEEM,
   Zetasizer and TEM confirmed the successful synthesis of the nanosized
   materials. The results of the photocatalytic experiments showed
   efficient degradation of the dye, which amounted to 60% and 98% over a
   period of 180 min for the synthetic water and spiked real wastewater,
   respectively. The pseudo-first-order model was found to be a better fit
   for both the synthetic and spiked real wastewater samples. The
   coefficient of correlation (R-2) of 0.991 and 0.996 was obtained for the
   synthetic and real wastewaters, respectively. The rate of discoloration
   decreased with increasing concentration of the dyes. The data
   demonstrated that an increase in the reaction rate constant resulted in
   faster dye discoloration and higher catalytic activity and yielded
   shorter half-lives. The degradation of dye was attributed to a
   combination of photocatalytic mechanism and photosensitization
   degradation emanating from the self-degradation of photoexcited dyes.
   The reactive oxygen radicals and holes played a role in the degradation
   of the dye molecules. Additionally, the photolytic contribution was
   minor, while the photocatalytic activity of GOQDs was the major to the
   degradation process. The results showed that GOQDs can be used in the
   treatment of wastewater effluent for the detoxification and
   discoloration of the harmful dye.

   identified as Aspergillus flavus and Fusarium oxysporium based on
   morphological and molecular methods. The highest decolorization
   percentage of 78.12 +/- 2.1% was attained in the biotreatment with
   fungal consortium followed by A. flavus and F. oxysporium separately
   with removal percentages of 54.68 +/- 1.2% and 52.41 +/- 1.0%,
   respectively. Additionally, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy of the
   treated effluent showed that a maximum peak (lambda(max)) of 415 nm was
   reduced as compared with the control. The indicators of wastewater
   treatment efficacy, namely total dissolved solids, total suspended
   solids, conductivity, biological oxygen demand, and chemical oxygen
   demand with removal percentages of 78.2, 78.4, 58.2, 78.1, and 77.6%,
   respectively, demonstrated a considerable decrease in values due to
   fungal consortium treatment. The reduction in peak and mass area along
   with the appearance of new peaks in GC-MS confirms a successful
   biodegradation process. The toxicity of treated textile effluents on the
   seed germination of Vicia faba was decreased as compared with the
   control. The shoot length after irrigation with effluents treated by the
   fungal consortium was 15.12 +/- 1.01 cm as compared with that treated by
   tap-water, which was 17.8 +/- 0.7 cm. Finally, we recommended the
   decrease of excessive uses of synthetic dyes and utilized biological
   approaches for the treatment of real textile effluents to reuse in
   irrigation of uneaten plants especially with water scarcity worldwide.

AB It was investigated the potential of Rhodococcus erythropolis AW3 as a
   biosorbent for the removal of crystal violet (CV) dye from natural water
   and real effluents. The biosorbent was characterized by flow cytometry,
   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), energy X-ray dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and point
   of zero charge (pH(ZPC)). Batch biosorption experiments were performed
   to optimize different parameters involved in the biosorption process.
   The equilibrium was reached at 90 min at the optimum biosorbent dose of
   0.50 g L-1 and pH of 9.0. Results indicated that Langmuir isotherm model
   was the most suitable to represent the experimental data, and the
   highest biosorption capacity was 289.8 mg g(-1). Kinetic data were well
   fitted with the pseudo-second-order model. The thermodynamic study
   showed that the process was favorable, exothermic, and associated with

AB In a previous work [1], the treatment of dye solutions containing
   Remazol Red BR (RRB) and Novacron Blue C-D (NB) by anodic oxidation
   using boron doped diamond anode (BDD) demonstrated that the
   electrochemical treatment is an efficient alternative for removing color
   and chemical oxygen demand (COD) and this technology can be used for
   depuration of real effluents. More recently, these assumptions have been
   confirmed by oxidizing electrochemically a real textile effluent using
   BDD anode [2]. Then, as a further development of the research carried
   out in these previous studies [1,2], in the present work, it has been
   considered appropriate to extend the investigation to the anodic
   oxidation, using BDD anode, of a specific real effluent discharged by
   Brazilian textile industry, adding Na2SO4 or NaCl salts in order to
   verify the applicability of this treatment producing in situ strong
   oxidant species (peroxodisulfates or active chlorine, respectively).
   In this study, we also attempt to discuss critical evidence about the
   viability of peroxodisulfates or active chlorine. Results obtained in
   this research clearly demonstrated that the effect of the
   electrogenerated strong oxidant species, peroxodisulfates or active
   chlorine, depends on electrocatalytic mechanism followed on BDD surface,
   improving the color and COD removal. However, there is a limit of NaCl
   for treating real effluents avoiding the formation of organochloride
   compounds; and it is a subject of critical importance, from the
   environmental point of view, to apply this alternative treatment. (c)

   treatment. Poly-aluminum chloride (PACl) was selected and used in the
   experiments. Batch experiment results showed that the optimal dosage was
   40mg Al/L. During the pilot-scale experiment, the suitable dosage and
   dosing interval were once per day at the dosage of 40mg Al per L of
   amount of mixed liquor into the HCMBR system. It was found that membrane
   fouling was effectively retarded by PACl addition in the running MBR
   system. Additionally, removal of pollutants according to influent and
   effluent quality was monitored. HCMBR achieved much higher removal
   efficiencies than membrane bioreactor (MBR) in CODcr, UV254, and total
   phosphate, due to PACl coagulation in the HCMBR bioreactor. And the
   application of PACl was effective in decreasing the content of
   extracellular polymeric substances and the membrane fouling resistances.
   The transmembrane pressure of HCMBR developed much slower than that of
   MBR, which indicated that coagulation with PACl in the MBR could
   alleviate membrane fouling. PACl addition was practically feasible for
   real textile dyeing wastewater advanced treatment without large excess
   sludge production.

AB The present study shows sorption capacity of the metallurgical dust, for
   the anionic dye-Reactive Blue 19, from aqueous solutions and real
   textile wastewater. The sorption processes were carried out in batch
   method at six doses of: 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 g/L. The highest
   maximum sorption capacity of the dust in relation to the dye from
   aqueous solution has been estimated for sorbent dose of 2 g/L, it was
   319.2 mg/g, and the removal efficiency (RE) was at the level of 62.7%.
   The experimental data have been analyzed by the Langmuir, Freundlich,
   and Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherm models, using nonlinear regression. To
   determine the best fit isotherm 3 error functions were used. Reactive
   Blue 19 from aqueous solutions was probably bound by the electrostatic
   attraction between the anionic dye and positively charged surface of the
   dust. Comparing sorption of the Reactive Blue 19 dye from aqueous
   solution and textile wastewater, it was observed that for all doses of
   the metallurgical dust the dye was removed in higher amounts from
   wastewater, probably due to the presence of the auxiliary substances
   used in dyeing processes. The RE of the dye was very high both from
   aqueous solution and textile wastewater, in the range of 84.90-99.92%
   and 96.48-99.99%, respectively. The results showed that dust from a
   steel plant, containing iron oxides, can be used as low-cost and
   effective sorbent to remove reactive dye from aqueous solution and
   textile wastewater.

   fungus. The resulting biomass was named BTV, characterized by analytical
   techniques such as SEM, EDX, FTIR, BET, and BarrettJoyner- Halenda (BJH)
   model. pH, kinetic, and equilibrium adsorption studies with the Acid
   Blue 161 (AB-161) dye were investigated at 303.15 K. The kinetics of the
   biosorption process were examined at 600.00 and 1300 mg L-1, using
   pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, and Avrami fractional-order
   models. The maximum biosorption capacity of BTV for AB-161 dye was 221.6
   mg g(-1). Considering the biosorption data and the functional groups of
   BTV, it can be inferred that the sorption mechanism of AB-161 is
   regulated by electrostatic interactions between ionized dye molecules
   and negative charges on BTV in an aqueous solution. Finally, the BTV was
   tested with a simulated effluent with 89.47% efficiency, presenting the
   BTV as a biosorbent for real effluents polluted with dyes.

AB The aim of this work was to study the feasibility of treating real
   textile wastewater by combined chemical coagulation (using poly aluminum
   chloride (PAC) as coagulant), electrocoagulation (using aluminum
   electrodes), and adsorption process (using pistachio nut shell ash) to
   achieve the required standards. The influence of the critical operating
   variables such as coagulant dose, electrical potential, reaction time,
   and adsorbent dose on the removal efficiencies of major pollutants was
   determined. The results of this study were showed that removal of
   pollutants increased with increasing doses of PAC and applied voltage.
   The chemical coagulation process showed 40% of chemical oxygen demand
   (COD), 34% of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), 23.7% TSS, and 44.5% of
   dye removal efficiency, even though using relatively low PAC
   concentration (30mg/L). COD, BOD5, and dye removals of 93.1, 88.8, and
   98.6% were achieved by electrocoagulation process (applied voltage 60V).
   In addition, COD, BOD5, and dye removals of 98, 94.2, and 99.9% were
   achieved by overall combined process (chemical coagulation,
   electrocoagulation, and adsorption processes). The experiments
   demonstrated the effectiveness of combined processes for the treatment
   of real textile wastewaters. Consequently, combined processes are
   inferred to be superior to these processes alone for the removal of both
   organic and inorganic compounds from textile wastewater.

AB Water scarcity is a global problem, therefore the reuse and recycling of
   water is promoted in all sectors and it is a real alternative for the
   conservation of water resources. The industrial sector is a key point in
   the reuse of water as it is a major consumer of this precious resource.
   The textile industry consumes more than one hundred liters of water per
   kilogram of finished fabric during the dyeing and finishing processes.
   The wastewater generated by this industry is generally coloured and can
   also contain other recalcitrant compounds. In addition, some textile
   effluents have high salinity and are highly alkaline. In this work, a
   new treatment using a natural coagulant, Moringa Oleifera extract, is
   presented. Coagulant solution was made from moringa seed ground
   degreased and was tested at variable concentration (1000-5000 mg/l) on
   different dyeing wastewater samples. Exhausted dyeing liquors and
   residual washing baths samples were efficiently treated. Up to 90%
   colour removal was achieved, preserving at the same time the alkaline
   and saline properties of the water. Consequently, the treated effluents
   could be reused in new dyeing processes with successful results. It was
   shown that the implementation of this practice would have considerable
   environmental and economic benefits.

   (AOPs) were used to treat the real textile dyeing wastewater as a final
   step to remove color, COD and other refractory organic compounds, which
   were partially removed using a biological process. In this study,
   biologically treated effluent obtained from a textile industry was
   treated for recycling in textile wet processing for dyeing. The
   wastewater presents a lilac color, with an average chromaticity number
   (DFZ) of 100.8, alkaline pH (7.9), COD value of 186.5 mg/L, and total
   organic carbon (TOC) of 62.3 mg/L. Closed water loop recycling solution
   after trying a number of treatment option is proposed for achieving
   sustainability in industrial water consumption. UV/H2O2/O-3 was
   evaluated as the most effective combination with reuse potential of
   663,000 m(3)/year (with 85% water recovery, 100% color, and 60.1% COD
   removal) whereas the performance of ozone (O-3), ozone/ultraviolet
   (O-3/UV) and ozone/hydrogen peroxide (O-3/H2O2) was almost the same.
   However, highest color and COD removals were achieved using Fenton
   oxidation but reusability potential was zero. Treated wastewater (by
   O-3, O-3/UV, UV/H2O2/O-3, O-3/H2O2) was safely recycled for dyeing
   purposes with 35% and 20% less NaCl and Na2CO3 addition to dye bath,
   respectively. The estimated saving was calculated as 122,400 US$/year
   for this reduction.

   solutions. In this experimental study, a reactor with a useful volume of
   500 mL and 2 electrodes made of iron were used. The factors affecting
   dye removal (pH, voltage, hydrogen peroxide concentration, initial dye
   concentration, type and concentration of electrolyte, distance between
   electrodes, and time) were examined. Results revealed that the
   considered parameters affected the efficiency of the process. The
   maximum removal efficiency rates for Acid Red 18 dye under optimal
   process conditions (pH 3, voltage of 30 V, hydrogen peroxide
   concentration of 1 ml/L, electrolyte concentration of 100 mg/L, and
   electrode distance of 1 cm from each other) in synthetic and real
   solutions (wastewater from the Asia wool knitting factory) were found to
   be 99.9% +/- 0.2% and 90.5% +/- 1.7%, respectively. The electro-Fenton
   process with iron electrodes is a rapid and effective method for
   removing dye compounds from industrial wastewaters with a high

AB The impact caused by dye effluent discharge on the environment is well
   known. The study explores a hybrid method of combining Fenton oxidation
   with biological treatment by a defined bacterial consortium for the
   biodegradation of an effluent containing toxic azo dye (acid blue 113).
   In actual treatment process, the fluctuation in toxic load and presence
   of other dyeing chemical inhibits the activity of the bacterial
   consortium. An effective pre-treatment of effluent would ensure the
   optimal degradation irrespective of its initial load. The pretreatment
   of dye effluent with Fenton (H2O2 & Fe2+), considerably reduced the dye
   concentration by 40% and a maximum dye degradation of 85% (i.e., 45% by
   biodegradation) was achieved in shake flask. The biodegradation process
   was investigated in a bioreaction calorimeter (BioRc1e), the heat
   profile, bioenergetics data along with CER (Carbon dioxide emission
   rate) and OUR (Oxygen uptake rate) provided vital information for the
   effective commercial scale up. Enhanced degradation of up to 97% was
   achieved in BioRc1, the CER and OUR profile follows the power-time
   profile alluding that the heat generated is the resultant effect of
   bacterial metabolic activity. In real dye bath effluent the Fenton
   pre-oxidized biodegradation reaction showed a degradation efficacy of
   89.5% and considerable COD reduction of 93.7%. Fluorescence-activated
   cell sorting (FACS) analysis revealed a better bacterial cell
   proliferation in pre-treated experiment and gas chromatography and mass
   spectrum analysis were used for prediction of metabolites. The unique
   combination of Fenton and the microbial consortia is a competitive
   technology for industrial effluent treatment processes.

   (Morocco). Experiments were performed in an electrochemical reactor
   using Ti/Pt anode. Response surface methodology and full factorial
   central composite design were used to investigate the combined effect of
   three independent operating parameters considered for the optimization
   of the EO process: electrolysis time (t), current density (j) and
   temperature (T). Chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal (Y-1) and specific
   energy consumption (SEC) in kWh/kg of COD removed (Y-2) were used as
   responses to examine the degradation of wastewater. The obtained
   quadratic model was statistically tested using analysis of variance. The
   correlation coefficients for the model (R-2) were 0.9986 and 0.9830 for
   COD removal and SEC, respectively. The best conditions for maximum COD
   removal and minimum specific energy consumption in the present study
   were t = 2.11 h, j = 18.70 mA/cm(2) and T = 286.18 K. Under these
   optimum conditions, 81.2% of COD removal was observed with energy
   consumption of 93.85 kWh/kg of COD removal. Fourier transformed infrared
   spectroscopy analysis was used for the characterization of effluent.
   Evolution of inorganic ions concentration and changes of turbidity, pH
   and conductivity of wastewater during the EO process were also followed.

AB In the present article, a new adsorbent synthesized from Salvadora

   synthesized adsorbent was carried out using the techniques of FTIR, SEM,
   BET, zeta potential and MS. The effect of pH, adsorbent dose, contact
   time, initial dye concentration and temperature were assessed in batch
   operation. Maximum removal was favored at pH of 2, adsorbent dose of 2
   g/L and temperature as 333 K. Chemical activation has increased surface
   area of raw adsorbent from 58.38 to 124.99 m(2)/g. Nonlinear regression
   has been applied for the model fitting of the experimental data. Kinetic
   data was well described by pseudo-second-order model. Weber-Morris model
   established involvement of multiple steps in governing the adsorption
   mechanism. Isotherm data was well described by Freundlich model. Root
   mean square error analysis was also applied to check the best model
   fitting. Maximum adsorption capacity values were obtained as 74.28 and
   141.30 mg/g for raw adsorbent and activated adsorbent, respectively.
   Thermodynamic calculations established endothermic and feasible nature
   of the adsorption. The obtained removal of 97.24 +/- 0.69% for simulated
   solution reduced to 91.17 +/- 0.86% in case of real effluent containing
   100 mg/L of dye solution as attributed to other compounds present in the
   actual industrial effluent which can compete on adsorption sites along
   with the targeted dye. Reusability study performed using ethanol as an
   eluent confirmed suitability of synthesized adsorbent for dye removal
   from wastewater. The obtained maximum adsorption capacity along with

AB In this study, the electrochemical treatment has been investigated in
   the real acidic effluent of copper-phthalocyanine dye manufacturing
   plant. Galvanostatic batch electrolyses have been carried out in an
   undivided cell using stainless steel as cathode, dimensionally stable
   anode (DSA) and graphite as anodes at different current densities and
   temperatures. The influence of these variables on current efficiency,
   cell voltage, energy consumption and deposit quality was reported. Under
   optimized conditions, the maximum copper recovery of 98% and COD removal
   efficiency of 87.3% with the energy consumption of about 11.23 kWh/kg of
   Cu and 6.08 kWh/kg of COD, respectively at 30 degrees C were achieved in
   the acidic raw effluent using 2D parallel-plate cathode. While in 3D
   stainless steel turning cathode reactor. 99.5% of copper can efficiently
   be recovered from dilute solution with an acceptable current efficiency
   of about 56.8% with minimum energy consumption of 2.37 kWh/kg of Cu. The
   experimental results suggested that the efficiency of copper removal is
   hindered by the presence of organic species in the mixed industrial
   effluent. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Using the novel Fe(0)-TiO2-doped catalyst, the degradation of Bismarck
   Brown G dye was compared by means of advanced oxidation processes, such
   as sonolysis (13 mm and 25 mm probe tip diameters), photolysis (UV
   light) and sonophotolysis. The effect of the initial dye solution pH,
   H2O2 concentration, gas bubbling (argon, oxygen, air and nitrogen), dye
   concentration and reaction volume were studied. Understanding the
   degradation mechanism from these studies, the Bismarck Brown G dye
   treatment was further intensified by catalytic treatments, such as
   commercial TiO2, synthesized Fe(0) and synthesized Fe(0)-doped TiO2
   under sonolytic, photolytic and sonophotolytic irradiations. SEM, TEM,
   XRD and DRS characterization studies of the sonolytically synthesized
   catalyst shows that they were of uniform shape, nanoscale in size and
   had good absorption properties. Among the processes studied,
   sonophotocatalytic treatment of Bismarck Brown G dye in the presence of
   Fe(0)-doped TiO2 showed the highest colour removal with the smallest
   amount of catalyst addition and for larger reaction volume. The
   practical applicability of the synergistic effects with real textile
   effluent signifies that the studied process is highly efficient for a
   safer environment.

AB Globally, organic dyes are major constituents in wastewater effluents
   due to their large-scale industrial applications. These persistent
   pollutants adversely impact the public health of different living
   entities. Thus, wastewater remediation has become an indispensable
   necessity. Herein, we greenly synthesized iron oxide nanoparticles
   (SP-IONPs) using Spirulina platensis microalgae to remove cationic
   crystal violet (CV) and anionic methyl orange (MO) dyes from their
   aqueous solution. The engineered sorbent was thoroughly scrutinized by
   different characterization techniques of FT-IR, BET surface area, SEM,
   EDX, TEM, VSM, UV/Vis spectroscopy, and pH(PZC) measurement. The
   proficiency of SP-IONPs was methodically appraised for its sorptive
   performance towards the target CV and MO dyes under variable
   technological parameters (batch scenario). Collectively, the outlined
   results inferred an amazing efficacy characterized to the SP-IONPs
   sorbent for the expulsion of relevant dyes from the aqueous media.
   Regarding the dynamic static sorption data, the kinetics profile was
   ascribed to the pseudo-second order model, whereas sorption isotherm was
   quantitatively dominated by the Langmuir theory with maximum sorption
   capacities of 256.4 mg g(-1) and 270.2 mg g(-1) for CV and MO,
   respectively. Thermodynamics findings conformed the endothermic nature
   of sorption process. Repeatability of the spent sorbent was successfully
   emphasized for 5 times of sorption/desorption cycles. The productive
   sorbent admirably sequestered CV and MO dyes from spiked tap water. The
   potency of SP-IONPs as color collecting material from real dyeing
   effluents was achieved.

AB In this current work, the performance of an aerobic granular sludge
   (AGS) for real textile wastewater was investigated based on system
   operational parameters evaluation. The study was performed for 90 days,
   and sampling was done once a week in which textile dyeing effluent from
   the textile mill was collected and subjected to laboratory-scale
   treatment. The samples from the inlet, the outlet of the wastewater
   plant, and within the bioreactor were collected at various
   concentrations of mixed liquid suspended solids (MLSS), and hydraulic
   retention remained the same in the investigated period of 53 h. The
   objective of this study was to analyze the AGS system performance
   assessment by evaluating the effect of different MLSS concentrations on
   chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solids (TSS), and
   oil/grease removal from real-based textile water. The results showed
   that removal of organic material from the process water increases with
   an increase in MLSS concentration in the bioreactor and gradually shifts
   removal of COD from 91.2% to 94.5%. As the concentration of
   microorganisms in the reactor (aeration tank) increases, the degradation
   of waste organics in the wastewater increases as well. Moreover, the %
   removal of TSS (83.5% to 98%) and removal of oil/grease (62.5% to 76.4%)
   were also increased. These results ultimately suggest that the
   utilization of an activated sludge system can effectively treat complex
   and highly polluted denim textile wastewater to avoid secondary
   pollution posed by this industry.
   Practitioner Points:
   The effectiveness of aerobic granular sludge was investigated for
   industrial textile effluent.
   The increase in MLSS results in increase of % COD removal efficiency to
   94.5%.
   The AGS system can efficiently treat complicated and highly contaminated
   textile wastewater.

   the electrodes. The study focuses on the efficiency of the electrodes
   and catalyst used for the successful removal of Rhodamine B (RhB) from
   aqueous solution and the application of the same in real textile
   wastewater. The effect of various operational parameters like pH,
   applied voltage, catalyst concentration, initial pollutant concentration
   and effect of ions were investigated. The optimized condition of the
   electrolytic system was found as pH 3, applied voltage of 3 V, and
   catalyst concentration of 20 mg L-1 for the removal of 10 ppm RhB. At
   the optimized condition, 97.51% +/- 0.0002 RhB removal was obtained
   after an electrolysis time of 60 min. The role of individual systems of
   Fe, Mn, GO and MnFe2O4 without support were compared with that of
   catalyst composite. On examining the practical viability in real textile
   effluent, a significant colour reduction was observed (reduced by 61.24%
   +/- 0.0261 in 60 min). Along with this, the biodegradability enhancement
   (BOD/COD ratio from 0.07 to 0.21) after treatment was also observed.

AB Construction of a multipurpose yeast consortium suitable for lipid
   production, textile dye/effluent removal and lignin valorization is
   critical for both biorefinery and bioremediation. Therefore, a novel
   oleaginous consortium, designated as OYC-Y.BC.SH has been developed
   using three yeast cultures viz. Yarrowia sp. SSA1642, Barnettozyma
   californica SSA1518 and Sterigmatomyces halophilus SSA1511. The
   OYC-Y.BC.SH was able to grow on different carbon sources and accumulate
   lipids, with its highest lipid productivity (1.56 g/L/day) and lipase
   activity (170.3 U/mL) exhibited in xylose. The total saturated fatty
   acid content was 36.09 %, while the monounsaturated and poly-unsaturated
   fatty acids were 45.44 and 18.30 %, respectively, making OYC-Y.BC.SH
   valuable for biodiesel production. The OYC-Y.BC.SH showed its highest
   decolorization efficiency of Red HE3B dye (above 82 %) in presence of
   sorghum husk as agricultural co-substrate, suggesting its feasibility
   for simultaneous lignin valorization. The significant higher performance
   of OYC-Y.BC.SH on decolorizing the real dyeing effluent sample at pH 8.0
   suggests its potential and suitability for degrading most of the
   wastewater textile effluents. Clearly, toxicological studies underline
   the additional advantage of using OYC-Y.BC.SH for bioremediation of
   industrial dyeing effluents in terms of decolorization and
   detoxification. A possible mechanism of Red HE3B biodegradation and ATP
   synthesis was also proposed.

AB The hybrid electrocoagulation-electrooxidation (EC-EO) process was
   evaluated for its capability to remove color, total organic carbon
   (TOC), and chemical oxygen demand (COD). Aluminum (Al/Al) and iridium
   dioxide-coated onto titanium (IrO2/Ti) electrodes were selected as
   anode/cathode for EC and EC-EO experiments, respectively. The
   box-Behnken statistical experimental design was used to optimize
   different operating conditions of the processes. The selected EC
   operating parameters are the concentrated dye concentration, applied
   current density, electrolysis time, and pH. The three chosen operating
   conditions for hybrid EC-EO processes are applied current density, pH,
   and electrolysis time. The results were evaluated based on the
   interaction effects of operating parameters of the treatment methods on
   the percentage of COD, TOC, and color removal. The EC process achieved
   89% color and 76% COD removal rate at the optimum operating conditions.
   Likewise, the hybrid EC-EO process obtained 97% COD and color removal
   efficiency. FT-IR and 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy combined approach was
   employed to analyze the dye degradation extent. Both analysis results
   confirm the complete degradation of the organic contaminants into carbon
   dioxide and water. Thus, this study discloses that the treatment method
   using mesh IrO2/Ti electrodes is a promising technology that could reach
   the discharge limit for industrial effluents. In addition, the optimum
   operating conditions are tested for real industrial wastewater effluents
   and show excellent performance in removing pollutants. Furthermore, the
   treatment method's mineralization study and economic analysis were
   performed and compared to other studies.

AB Generation of secondary sludge is a major concern of textile dye removal

   treatment system has been found efficient in degradation of coagulated

   to coagulate textile dyestuff from real textile wastewater with 98 %
   color removal. Novel consortium-BBA was found to decolorize coagulated
   dye sludge. Parameters that significantly affect coagulation process
   were optimized using response surface methodology. The bench-scale
   stirred tank reactor (50-L capacity) designed with optimized parameters
   for coagulation process could efficiently remove 98, 89, 78, and 67 % of
   American Dye Manufacturer's Institute (ADMI) in four repetitive cycles,
   respectively. Solid-state fermentation composting reactor designed to
   treat coagulated dye sludge showed 96 % removal of dye within 10 days.
   Coagulation of dyes from textile wastewater and degradation of
   coagulated dye sludge were confirmed by Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis. Cell morphology assay, comet assay, and
   phytotoxicity confirmed the formation of less toxic products after
   coagulation and degradation mechanism.

   characterization of the GNS showed their presence as overlapped sheets
   of different length and width, and with an average thickness of 20.0 nm
   and a high specific surface area of 279 m(2) g(-1). The influence of
   different experimental conditions on removal efficiency such as pH of
   the solution, GNS mass, contact time, solution temperature, and ionic
   strength were investigated. The results from the experimental data
   showed GNS can remove most of W ions and RhB species from the aqueous
   solution in 30 min, at pH 1.0, with adsorption efficiency of 99.1% using
   17.5 mg of GNS, and with adsorption capacity 93.5 mg of W g(-1) of GNS
   and 41.8 mg of RhB g(-1) of GNS. The removal process of W ions and RhB
   dye by GNS were studied kinetically using different kinetic models, and
   the results indicated the pseudo-second-order kinetic model suitability
   for the adsorption process description. The removal process was studied
   thermodynamically, and the results revealed that the removal was
   spontaneous, endothermic in nature, and associated with increase in
   random-ness. Finally, the efficiency of GNS for the adsorption of
   tungsten ions and rhodamine B dye from real samples were explored using
   three different real environmental water samples. The data confirms that
   GNS has great efficiency in removing tungsten ions and rhodamine B dye
   from aqueous solution.

AB Feasibility, optimisation and modelization of textile cationic dyes
   (TCD) removal and recovery from industrial wastewaters by batch mode
   capacitive deionization (BMCDI), with activated carbon (AC) electrodes,
   were investigated.
   The synergy hypothesis, AC adsorption-electrochemical double layer
   effects, was verified and measured by the high CDI efficiency
   (approximate to 99%) which was three times higher than conventional AC
   adsorption, demonstrating the intensification of the TCD removal by CDI.
   Unlike the adsorption and biological established treatments, the BMCDI
   presents real environmental performance and sustain ability (recycling
   of pristine treated water, recovery of TCD and clean regeneration of AC
   electrodes).
   This research study was mainly focused on the concentration time (C-t)
   and q(X/M)-t curves of batch runs, at different pHs, applied voltages
   (V) or flow rates (Q). The BMCDI efficiency was measured by the final
   equilibrium concentration C-fineq and electrode specific adsorption,
   q(X/M).
   CDI has rarely been studied as removal and recovery method of TCD. This
   BMCDI approach is thus quite novel and potentially applicable. (C) 2018

AB The discharge of effluents from the textile industry is a
   multidimensional problem that affects the ecosystem in many ways. Though
   many new technologies are being developed, it remains to be seen which
   of those can be practiced in a real scenario. The current investigation
   attempts to absorb the Malachite Green, an effluent from textile dye
   using Chinese Fan Palm Seed Biochar. Accordingly, biochar was prepared
   using fruits of Chinese Fan Palm (Livistona chinensis) tree. The fruit
   also yielded a significant amount of biochar and bio-oil. 1.346 kg of
   fresh and cleaned fruit was fast pyrolyzed at 500 degrees C in a
   laboratory-scale Pyrolyzer resulting in 0.487 kg of biochar and 0.803 L
   of bio-oil. The remaining fruit matter was converted to gaseous
   products. The kinetics of dye removal were studied and the parameters
   were determined. The study advocates that the Langmuir isotherm model
   simulates the adsorption experiment, to a good extent. From the plot,
   the maximum (monolayer) adsorption capacity, Qm was determined to be
   21.4 mg/g. The suitability of the Langmuir isotherm model onto biochar
   was established by the high correlation coefficient, R2 that was higher
   than 0.97.

AB A facile method was approached to synthesize a new series of highly
   porous polyethylene glycol (PEG) and Ag-ZnO (AZO) grafted polyaniline
   (PANI) nanocomposites (PAPE/AZO) for investigation of the adsorption
   behavior of brilliant green dye (BG). The compositions of Ag (1, 3 and
   5%) in AZO were varied to assess the influence of bimetallic oxide
   incorporation. The nanocomposites were characterized by FTIR, XRD, SEM
   and TEM analyses. The adsorption performance of the PAPE/AZO was
   assessed by various parametric changes viz. contact time, pH,
   temperature, concentration of the dye and adsorbent dosage. The highest
   adsorption capacity of 94.46 mg g(-1) was achieved at the optimum
   conditions of 0.075 g adsorbent dosage, 70 mg L-1 dye concentration, 1%
   AZO and pH 2. BET and BJH analyses of the nanocomposite confirmed the
   higher surface area and pore volume with lower amount of AZO that
   supported PAPE for enhanced dye removal. The Langmuir isotherm model
   fits the equilibrium conditions indicating a homogeneous distribution of
   active sites on the surface of the nanocomposite. Adsorption kinetic
   model ensued pseudo second order exhibiting chemisorption process. From
   the results, it is obvious that PAPE/AZO can be used as a potential core
   substance for treating real-time industrial dye effluents.

AB This work deals with the treatment of textile effluents by the
   heterogeneous Fenton-like process in a fixed-bed reactor filled with a
   catalyst based on activated carbon impregnated with iron (AC/Fe). In a
   preliminary stage, the dye Alcian Blue-tetrakis (methylpyridinium) was
   used as model compound. The catalyst is essentially microporous, with
   large micropores and some mesopores, and is able to adsorb the dye,
   although its adsorption capacity is limited as a consequence of the
   large size of the dye molecule. The stability of the catalyst was
   checked with five consecutive runs, without significant loss of activity
   (less than 5%). Then, the effect of the main operating conditions was
   analyzed, and the H2O2 dose, pH and temperature were optimized; the best
   conditions found using C-AB,C-feed = 0.01 mM and a contact time of 3.3 g
   min ml(-1) were: C-H2O2,C-feed = 30.0 mM, pH = 2.5 and T= 50 degrees C,
   with which it was achieved 93.2% of discoloration and 54.1% of total
   organic carbon (TOC) removal in the steady-state. It was verified that
   pH had a preponderant effect on the oxidation performance. Finally, the
   selected catalytic system was applied to the treatment of a real textile
   effluent used in the cotton dyeing. It was achieved almost total
   discoloration (96.7%) and a strong abatement of the TOC - 73.6%, as well
   as of the chemical oxygen demand (COD) - 663%, and biochemical oxygen
   demand (BOD5) - 72.5%. The iron leached reached very low levels in every
   run, which is a crucial factor for the catalyst long-term use. (C) 2013

AB Polyaniline modified MoO3 composites were synthesized via a chemical
   oxidative polymerization method and employed as a novel adsorbent for
   Rhodamine B (RhB), Congo red (CR) and textile dye effluent. In this
   preparation, camphor-10-sulphonic acid was used as a dopant and ammonium
   peroxydisulphate was used as an oxidant for the fabrication of
   polyaniline. The MoO3/polyaniline composites were characterized by
   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy,
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-Vis spectroscopy and
   elemental analysis. The results confirm the successful formation of the
   MoO3/polyaniline composite. The surface morphology of the samples was
   characterized by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron
   microscopy. The obtained images show the formation of polyaniline-coated
   MoO3. The adsorption performance of the prepared composites towards RhB
   and CR was analyzed. The effect of pH on adsorptive removal was
   investigated. The adsorption isotherm studies were carried out and the
   results showed that the equilibrium data fitted well to the Langmuir
   isotherm equation. The MoO3/polyaniline (aniline, 30% w/w) composite
   shows better scavenging performance with maximum adsorption capacity of
   36.36 mg g(-1) and 76.22 mg g(-1) on RhB and CR dyes from water. In
   addition, the adsorptive performance on real textile effluent was also
   tested. The results show that the MoO3/polyaniline composite can be used
   as a cost-effective alternative adsorbent for the removal of organic
   pollutants from waste water.

AB In this work, a potential biosorbent is prepared from agricultural waste
   material (ash seed) without any treatment. This biomaterial could be
   successfully used as a low-cost adsorbent for the removal of an anionic
   dye named Cibacron Blue (CB), under optimal conditions. The prepared
   adsorbent was characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM)
   coupled with EDX, Fourier transforms infrared spectrometer (FTIR),
   thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and point of zero charge (pHpzc). The
   adsorption experiments were carried out in batch mode at room
   temperature. Results show that the rate of CB dye removal exceeds 95 %
   using a dose of 2 g/L ash seed at C-0 = 25 mg/L and pH = 2.2. The
   kinetic data were analyzed using the pseudo-first-order,
   pseudo-second-order, Elovich's, Bangham, intraparticle diffusion, and
   Boyd kinetic. Results show that the pseudo-second-order model fits
   better the experimental data. The isotherm data of the CB dye adsorption
   were analyzed with several theoretical models (Langmuir, Freundlich, and
   monolayer model coupled to real gaz (MMRG)). It was found that the
   adsorption process of the CB dye is well described by monolayer model
   coupled to real gaz (MMRG) compared to other models. The negative
   enthalpy (Delta H degrees) and free enthalpy (Delta G degrees) indicate
   the physical and spontaneous nature of CB adsorption. Therefore, the
   prepared material can serve as a potential adsorbent for removal of CB
   dye from industrial effluents.

   and maintained 73.35% of its initial activity after 30 days, at 50
   degrees C. The effect of various metal and organicsolvent tolerance on
   PersiLac2 showed, retaining greater than 53% activity at 800 mM of metal
   ions, 52.12% activity at 6 M NaCl, and greater than 44.09% activity at
   20% organic solvents. PersiLac2 manifested effective removal of eight
   different textile dyes from azo, anthraquinone, and triphenylmethane
   families. It decolorized 500 mg/L of Alizarin yellow, Carmine, Congo red
   and Bromothymol blue with 99.74-55.85% efficiency after 15 min, at 50
   degrees C, without mediator. This enzyme could practically remove dyes
   from a real textile effluent and it displayed significant detoxification
   in rice seed germination tests. In conclusion, PersiLac2 could be useful
   in future for decolorization/detoxification of wastewater.

AB The processing of gemstones, mainly the dyeing step, generates a high
   volume of wastewater containing a high concentration of Rhodamine B.
   This wastewater is potentially toxic and contains non-biodegradable
   substances. For this reason, it is necessary to develop methodologies to
   treat this type of wastewater. Therefore, in this work, a sequential
   process of electro-Fenton conjugated with adsorption were developed to
   treat this type of wastewater. The gemstones dyeing wastewater presented
   between 735.5 and 1,943.0 mg L-1 of Rhodamine B. Firstly, the
   electro-Fenton process was applied, and removal superior to 65% of the
   RhB concentration were observed. Subsequently, adsorption was applied
   using a strong cationic resin at a pH of 2.0. In this condition, the
   adsorption capacity predicted by the Langmuir model was 247.3 mg g(-1).
   The breakthrough curves were inclined with a suitable mass transfer
   zone. The sequential process of electro-Fenton and fixed-bed adsorption
   were able to remove 100% of the RhB from the gemstones' wastewater,
   being an effective alternative to treat this type of effluent.

   waste sludges from potable water and mine water treatment. The waste was
   used directly without modification or reagent addition, as media/
   substrate in simple flow-through reactors for the decolourisation and
   biodegradation of methyl orange (MO) and mixed dyes textile effluent.
   Three phases of exploratory proof of concept work were undertaken.
   Columns containing HFO sludges were challenged with solution of MO, and
   MO amended with glycerol (Phase I), MO in a synthetic textile effluent
   recipe (Phase II), and real mixed textile effluent containing a mixture
   of dyes (Phase III). After an initial lag period extensive
   decolourisation of dye was observed in all cases at rates comparable
   with pure strains and engineered bioreactor processes, with evidence of
   biodegradation beyond simple cleavage of the mono azo chromophore and
   mineralisation. The microbiology of the initial sludge samples in both
   cases exhibited a diverse range of iron oxidising and reducing bacteria.
   However, post experiment the microbiology of sludge evolved from being
   dominated by Proteobacteria to being dominated by Firmicutes. Distinct
   changes in the microbial community structure were observed in
   post-treatment MWTS and WTWS where genera capable of iron and sulphate
   reduction and/or aromatic amine degradation were identified. Average
   nitrogen removal rates for the columns ranged from 27.8 to 194
   g/m(3)/day which is higher than engineered sequential anaerobic-aerobic
   bioreactor. Postulated mechanisms for the fast anaerobic
   decolourisation, biodegradation, and mineralisation of the dyes (as well
   nitrogen transformations) include various direct and indirect enzymatic
   and metabolic reactions, as well as reductive attack by continuously
   regenerated reductants such as Fe(II), HFO bound Fe(II), FeS, and HS.
   The ability of iron reducers to degrade aromatic rings is also
   considered important in the further biodegradation and complete
   mineralisation of organic carbon. The study reveals that abundant and
   ubiquitous HFO-rich waste sludges, can be used without amendment, as a
   substrate in simple flow-through bioremediation system for the
   decolourisation and partial biodegradation of dyes in textile effluent.

AB In this study, the performance of the anoxic filter bed and biological
   wriggle bed-ozone biological aerated filter (AFB-BWB-O-3-BAF) process
   treating real textile dyeing wastewater was investigated. After more
   than 2 month process operation, the average effluent COD concentration
   of the AFB, BWB, O-3-BAF were 704.8 mg/L, 294.6 mg/L and 128.8 mg/L,
   with HRT being 8.1-7.7 h, 9.2 h and 5.45 h, respectively. Results showed
   that the effluent COD concentration of the AFB decreased with new
   carriers added and the average removal COD efficiency was 20.2%. During
   operation conditions, HRT of the BWB and O-3-BAF was increased,
   resulting in a decrease in the effluent COD concentration. However, on
   increasing the HRT, the COD reduction capability expressed by the unit
   carrier COD removal loading of the BWB reactor increased, while that of
   the O-3-BAF reactor decreased. This study is a beneficial attempt to
   utilize the AFB-BWB-O-3-BAF combine process for textile wastewater
   treatment. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Indigenous halo-alkaliphilic bacterium Nesterenkonia lacusekhoensis
   EMLA3 isolated from alkaline textile effluent was used to degrade the
   widely used recalcitrant reactive red-35 dye, at high pH (11.5). The
   bacterium decolorized more than 90 % dye in nutrient broth (NB) within
   9-48 h up to 1000 mg L-1 dye concentration. Optimized multi-parameter
   combinations using Box-Behnken Design (BBD) model upgraded the
   degradation response, particularly at high dye concentrations, which was
   much higher than that obtained by optimizing one parameter at a time.
   The microbe when subjected to repeated dye exposure (9 h cycles),
   advanced the decolorization process, reducing the degradation time to 1
   h, which is attributable to short term acclimatization. Spectral scans
   (using UV-vis spectrophotometer) of microbe-treated dye gave evidence
   for breakdown of the complex aromatic dye structure into simpler low
   molecular weight metabolites. Kinetics of the reaction was analyzed and
   based on LCMS analyses of degrading dye metabolites, pathway of
   biotransformation has been proposed. Role of azoreductase was indicated
   in microbial degradation of the dye, and the final degraded products
   showed no phytotoxicity when tested using Vigna radiata seeds.
   Nesterenkonia was not only effective in removal of the dye in presence
   of heavy metals and salt that occur as co-pollutants in textile
   effluent, but it also removed the toxic Cr (VI) and COD from wastewater.
   A small supplement of starch as carbon source was found essential to
   trigger microbial action leading to degradation of the reactive red-35
   (RR-35) dye from simulated and real textile wastewater.

   subcritical water in the temperature range of 100 degrees C-200 degrees
   C for up to 60 min. Response surface methodology based on the
   Box-Behnken design was used to optimize the process. For Acid Red 1,
   optimum decolorization of 97% can be achieved at 192 degrees C, 181 mM
   H2O2, 51.3 min treatment time, and 121 mg/L dye concentration. For Acid
   Red 114, the optimum conditions were 195 degrees C, 157 mM H2O2, 38 min
   treatment time and 110 mg/L dye concentration, where 91% decolorization
   could be obtained from the proposed model. It was determined that
   temperature is the most important factor, followed by the oxidant
   concentration. Degradation was less efficient for AR114 due to the
   double azo bonds, compared to the single azo bond of AR1. Application of
   the optimum treatment conditions on real reactive dye wastewater
   resulted in 92.7, 79.1 and 20.4% removal of BOD5, COD and TSS,

   capacity towards various divalent ions such as Zn2+, Cu2+, Cd2+, Pb2+,
   Ni2+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ as well as various dyes such as methylene blue,

AB The present work describes the preparation and detailed characterization
   of porous chromium terephthalate metal-organic framework (MOF)
   impregnated polyacrylonitrile based hollow fiber membrane. The hollow
   fibers were characterized by their surface morphology, zeta potential,
   permeability, average pore diameter, molecular weight cut off (MWCO) and
   contact angle. Variation of MOF concentration upto 10 wt% resulted in
   43% reduction in membrane permeability. The corresponding change in MWCO
   was from 140 kDa to 70 kDa. The addition of MOF made the membrane more
   hydrophilic and at 10 wt% MOF, the contact angle was reduced to 52
   degrees from 86 degrees. The Fourier Transform Infrared Spectra (FTIR)
   of mixed matrix membrane (MMM) showed that there existed strong chemical
   interaction between MOF particles and polymer backbone, precluding the
   leaching of MOF from the membrane matrix over long term use. The MOF
   incorporated MMM exhibited tremendous adsorption capacity (197-260 mg/g
   for 10 wt% MOF doped fiber) towards reactive dyes commonly used in the
   textile industry. As the dye removal by MMM hollow fiber was based on
   the adsorption mechanism, the breakthrough behavior of the membrane was
   important to estimate the membrane life and onset of membrane
   regeneration. In the present work, a detailed two-dimensional transient
   transport model was developed for a multi-component real-life textile
   effluent from the first principles using the equation of continuity,
   momentum balance, species balance based on
   convective-diffusive-adsorptive solute transport in the hollow fiber.
   The model results were validated with the experimental data of a textile
   effluent having four reactive dyes. The multicomponent model was used
   for scaling up the actual hollow fiber based filtration system and the
   performance curve was generated relating the breakthrough volume, number
   and length of fibers.

AB An electro-precipitation method is proposed for the treatment of
   synthetic (2654.4 mg L-1 total Cr, pH 3.9) and real tanning effluents
   (2775 mg L-1 total Cr, pH 4.0) containing elevated concentrations of
   Cr(III). Aluminum and copper anodes are thermodynamically (Pourbaix-type
   diagrams) and electrochemically evaluated in the synthetic electrolyte,
   as potential candidates to generate the chromium precipitation. Copper
   is selected due to better dissolution properties and avoiding
   passivation. The choice of copper anode is effective in both solutions,
   generating Cu +2 species which displace the chromium species from
   Cr(III), and obtaining chromium recoveries > 99% for these cases. The
   total Cr concentration is decreased down to 0.12 mg L-1 in the real
   wastewater. Visual inspection of the treated synthetic solution and FTIR
   analysis reveal that a chromium hydroxide is formed as insoluble
   compound after the treatment, while cupric sulfate remains in the
   supernatant. A similar result is obtained for the real effluent, but
   other impurities and compounds different than chromium or copper are
   present in the precipitate. Although these species are not identified
   due to their complexity, they could be related to the nature of the
   tanning process, being derived from hide, surfactants, fixers and dyes.
   X-ray diffraction conducted for the sludge electro-generated from the
   treatment of the real tanning effluent support the FTIR and
   electrochemical evaluations, and this technique enables to identify that
   a very hydrated chromium hydroxide is formed after the treatment. The
   drying of this insoluble compound produces a distinctive hexagonal
   crystal of Cr(OH)33H(2)O, and dehydrated phases of chromium oxides (e.g.
   Cr2O3). These findings suggest that the electro-precipitation method
   herein proposed is efficacious to decrease the total chromium
   concentration below the maximum permissible limits (0.5 mg L-1).

   recirculation flow reactor configurations. Different operating
   conditions, such as current density, initial pH value, initial dye
   concentration, sacrificial anode materials and stirring rate were tested
   with the synthetic wastewater in order to optimise the treatment. The
   best operating conditions achieved for both systems were: current
   density of 16 mA cm(-2), initial pH of 6, 100 mg L-1 of RB5 and AI
   anodes, as well as 800 rpm for the batch-stirred setting. These
   parameters, at the batch-stirred EC system, led to 76% and 97% of
   decolourisation after 45 and 120 min of operation, with an energy
   consumption of 5 and 14 kWh m(-3), respectively. Similar colour removals
   were achieved for the recirculation flow system in 10 and 120 min,
   requiring 2 kWh m(-3) and 22 kWh m(-3) of electrical energy,
   respectively. The behaviours observed in each one of the EC systems (-
   batch and -recirculation flow) are related to the way how the liquid was
   mixed and the location where samples were taken. In the batch-stirred
   system, a real textile wastewater was also treated applying Al or Zn

   are alternatives to depurate effluents containing dyes, since they
   guarantee the legal limits values so that a treated wastewater can be

AB Sawdust of acacia tree has been successfully used to remove textile dyes
   from wastewater due to its good sorption properties and its good
   chemical stability. Two materials are prepared by chemical treatment,
   including acidic and basic sawdust of acacia. The biosorption tests were
   carried out on two synthetic dyes of textile which are methylene blue
   (MB) and brilliant blue (BB). Efficient removal of the both dyes has
   been achieved by the basic treated sawdust acacia. The modeling of
   biosorption kinetic shows that the biosorption of MB and that of BB are
   well described by the pseudo-first-order model for both the chemically
   treated biosorbents. Equilibrium data have also established using
   Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models. Langmuir biosorption capacities
   are 8.13 and 267.04 mg/g onto basic sawdust acacia and 6.19 and 230.76

AB The present study explored an efficient technoeconomic method for
   treating intensely colored dyeing effluents from a commercial source.
   Firstly, the adsorption efficacy of jute fiber (JF) was enhanced through
   grafting with tannin, a natural polyphenol, via incorporation of active
   epoxy groups by epichlorohydrin onto fiber surface. The effect of
   different experimental parameters (e.g., initial pH, adsorbent dose,
   temperature, and contact time) on extent of color removal was evaluated
   performing batch studies. A full factorial central composite design
   (CCD) in response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to optimize the
   decolorization process for achieving maximum color removal (99.5%) at pH
   4.9, adsorbent dose 11.8 g/L, temperature 30 degrees C, and time of
   contact 117.8 min. The isotherm and kinetic studies of the process
   revealed that Langmuir model and pseudo-second-order model provided best
   fit, yielding high correlation coefficients (R-2 > 0.997). Significant
   desorption (76%) of the spent adsorbent by 0.1 M NaOH solution suggested
   that this tannin-modified JF can find a prospective practical
   application as a novel, inexpensive, and potential bioadsorbent to treat
   the dyeing effluent.

AB This research work has been focused in the study of gallinaceous
   feathers, a waste that may be valorised as sorbent, to remove the Dark
   Blue Astrazon 2RN (DBA) from Dystar.
   This study was focused on the following aspects: optimization of
   experimental conditions through factorial design methodology, kinetic
   studies into a continuous stirred tank adsorber (at pH 7 and 20 degrees
   C), equilibrium isotherms (at pH 5, 7 and 9 at 20 and 45 degrees C) and
   column studies (at 20 degrees C, at pH 5, 7 and 9). In order to evaluate
   the influence of the presence of other components in the sorption of the
   dyestuff, all experiments were performed both for the dyestuff in
   aqueous solution and in real textile effluent.
   The pseudo-first and pseudo-second order kinetic models were fitted to
   the experimental data, being the latter the best fit for the aqueous
   solution of dyestuff. For the real effluent both models fit the
   experimental results and there is no statistical difference between
   them. The Central Composite Design (CCD) was used to evaluate the
   effects of temperature (15 - 45 degrees C) and pH (5 - 9) over the
   sorption in aqueous solution. The influence of pH was more significant
   than temperature. The optimal conditions selected were 45 degrees C and
   pH 9. Both Langmuir and Freundlich models could fit the equilibrium
   data. In the concentration range studied, the highest sorbent capacity
   was obtained for the optimal conditions in aqueous solution, which
   corresponds to a maximum capacity of 47 +/- 4 mg g(-1).
   The Yoon-Nelson, Thomas and Yan's models fitted well the column
   experimental data. The highest breakthrough time for 50% removal, 170
   min, was obtained at pH 9 in aqueous solution. The presence of the
   dyeing agents in the real wastewater decreased the sorption of the
   dyestuff mostly for pH 9, which is the optimal pH. The effect of pH is
   less pronounced in the real effluent than in aqueous solution. This work
   shows that feathers can be used as sorbent in the treatment of textile
   wastewaters containing DBA.

AB In this research, mesoporous calcium aluminate nanostructures
   (meso-CaAl2O4) were synthesized using a citric acid-assisted sol-gel
   auto-combustion process as the potential adsorbent to eliminate toxic
   triphenylmethane dye malachite green (MG) from synthetic/real effluent.
   The surface morphology of meso-CaAl2O4 was highly porous with nanometric
   size and non-homogeneous surface. The specific surface area, total pore
   volume, and BJH pore diameter of meso-CaAl2O4 were 148.5 m(2) g(-1),
   1.39 cm(3) g(-1), and 19 nm, respectively. The meso-CaAl2O4 also showed
   a very high heat resistance, due to losing only 7.95% of its weight up
   to 800 degrees C, which is mainly related to the moisture loss. The
   optimal adsorption conditions were obtained based on response surface
   methods (RSM)-central composite design (CCD) techniques. The Langmuir
   isotherm model was used for fitting the adsorption measurements, which
   presented 587.5 mg g(-1) as the maximum adsorption capacity of the dye.
   The data obtained from the adsorption kinetics model were found to
   correspond to the pseudo-second-order model. Also, the thermodynamic
   parameters including enthalpy change (Delta H degrees), entropy change
   (Delta S degrees), and Gibbs free energy change (Delta G degrees)
   indicated that MG dye adsorption by the meso-CaAl2O4 was feasible,
   endothermic, and occurred spontaneously. Furthermore, the meso-CaAl2O4
   was regenerated by microwave irradiation under 900 W at 6 min, and the
   MG dye removal efficiency was remained over 90% after the five cycles of
   microwave regeneration.

   co-immobilized on polyurethane, and the resulting HRP/GOx/polyurethane
   biocatalyst was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
   and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDAX) mapping techniques. The
   prepared biocatalyst was used for removal of acid orange 7 as model azo
   dye. The required H2O2 for activation of HRP was in-situ produced using
   GOx to prevent deactivation of HRP in the presence of excess chemical
   H2O2. Central composite design (CCD) was applied for modeling and
   optimization of parameters affecting the activity of prepared
   biocatalyst. Under the optimum conditions, removal efficiency of the azo
   dye was predicted to be 87.47%, which was in good agreement with the
   experimental value (89.69%). In addition, the performance of the
   prepared biocatalyst for removal of two other dyes with different
   structure was investigated at the optimum conditions, and a removal
   efficiency of 91.56% and 95.25% was obtained for removal of methylene
   blue and malachite green, respectively. The results demonstrated that
   the resultant HRP/GOx/Polyurethane biocatalyst was able to decrease the
   chemical oxygen demand (COD) of a textile effluent from 740mg/L to
   96mg/L, indicating that the prepared biocatalyst is an effective
   enzymatic system for treatment of real wastewater.

AB A hybrid approach for the remediation of recalcitrant dye wastewater is
   proposed. The chlorine-mediated electrochemical oxidation of real
   textile effluents and synthetic samples (using Ti/IrO2-RuO2-TiO2
   anodes), lead to discoloration by 92% and 89%, respectively, in 100 min,
   without significant mineralization. The remediation was obtained through
   biodegradation, after removing the residual bio-toxic active chlorine
   species via sunlight exposition. Results show that the electrochemical
   discoloration enhances the effluent biodegradability with about 90% COD
   removal employing acclimatized naphthalene-degrading bacterial
   consortia, within 144 h. Based on results obtained through FT-IR and
   GC-MS, it is likely that azo group stripping and oxidative cleavage of
   dyes occur due to the nucleophilic attack of active chlorine species
   during electro-oxidation. This leads to generation of aromatic
   intermediates which are further desulfonated, deaminated or oxidized
   only at their functional groups. These aromatic intermediates were
   mineralized into simpler organic acids and aldehydes by bacterial
   consortia. Phyto-toxicity trials on Vigna radiate confirmed the toxic
   nature of the untreated dye solutions. An increase in root and shoot
   development was observed with the electrochemically treated solutions,
   the same was higher in case of bio-treated solutions. Overall, obtained
   results confirm the capability of the proposed hybrid oxidation scheme
   for the remediation of textile wastewater. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

AB The fabrication of polymeric nanofibers and its potential versatility
   instigated to foster smart hybrid nanomaterials for the removal of
   environmental pollutants. In this pursuit, in this research work,
   polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-based two-dimensional (2D) nanofibrous mats with
   polyethyleneimine (PEI)/Fe and quaternary ammonium (QA)/Fe as hybrid
   fillers were prepared by the electrospinning process for the effective
   dye removal and bacterial disinfection. The characteristics of the
   fabricated nanomaterials were extensively explored by several analytical
   techniques such as field emission-scanning electron microscopy,
   transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis. Magnetic and
   thermal properties were investigated by superconducting quantum
   interference device and thermogravimetric measurements. The kinetic and
   isothermal models affirmed the adsorption behavior of the PAN-PEI/Fe
   nanofibers, and further regenerative studies substantiated the
   sustainability of the mats for the removal of industrial dye effluents.
   Subsequently, the magnetic-QA-loaded PAN nanofiber mats exhibited
   bactericidal killing efficacy of 99 and 89.5% in both Staphylococcus
   aureus and green fluorescence protein expressing Escherichia coli
   bacterial models evaluated from the conventional quantitative bacterial
   colony-counting assay. Disk diffusion method and microscopic
   investigations corroborated the disinfection efficacy with zone of
   inhibitions of similar to 23 and 33 mm, respectively. Interestingly, in
   vitro cell culture studies conducted in BHK-21 and NIH 3T3 cell lines
   demonstrated the cytocompatibility, and the in vivo toxicity
   investigations using the zebrafish models necessitated the real-time
   application of these nanofibrous mats. Therefore, the comprehensive
   study of the fabricated PAN-templated functionalized 2D nanofibrous mats
   affirmed to be competent for the remediation of industrial dye effluents
   and bacteria in water bodies.

AB Groundwater treatment waste (GWTW), as an environmentally friendly
   renewable nanomaterial, was implemented for the removal of anodized
   aluminum dye Sanodure Green (SG) from aqueous solutions. The capability
   of the SG metal complex dye removal was assessed by measuring solution
   decoloration and chromium elimination degree. GWTW was characterized
   using FTIR, SEM, EDX, TEM, XPS and surface area measurements. Kinetic
   curves were obtained by changing initial dye concentration, pH,
   temperature and adsorbent dose. Kinetic studies showed that up to 90 %
   of SG dye was removed within a contact time of 20 min. The adsorption of
   the dye was favourable at 293 K temperature in the acidic pH region (pH
   1.5-2.0) with maximum adsorption capacity 185 mg g(-1).
   Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm model as well as hyperbolic tangent,
   diffusion-chemisorption and Elovich kinetic models accurately describe
   the dye removal process. The calculated thermodynamic parameters
   confirmed that SG dye removal occurred spontaneously and exothermically.
   The magnitude of enthalpy change (Delta H degrees = similar to 35.80 kJ
   mol(-1)) was in agreement with the electrostatic interaction. The
   adsorption potential of GWTW for SGdye removal was also evaluated using
   a real waste water produced after dyeing of anodized aluminum.

AB Synthetic dyes are water soluble or dispersible aromatic compounds,
   having potential application in many industries. Discharge of dye
   contaminated industrial effluents into natural water sources can pose
   hazardous effects on the living systems. Hence, the treatment of colored
   effluents using efficient technologies is of major environmental
   concern. In the present study, a new and efficient geosorbent has been
   designed by coating alunite surface with manganese oxide to enhance dye
   adsorption ability of the natural mineral. Adsorption characteristics of
   the geosorbent were explored by means of optimization studies, isotherm
   and kinetic model applications. Adsorption yield was found to change by
   initial pH, geosorbent dosage, contact time, dye concentration and flow
   rate. High adsorption yield (98.48%) was obtained at pH 2.0 and using 20
   mg adsorbent. Adsorption equilibrium was attained within 5 min. Maximum
   Reactive Orange 13 adsorption capacity of geosorbent was 443.78 mg
   g(-1). The surface coated geosorbent also exhibited excellent
   performance in a dynamic flow mode with 97.70% adsorption yield at an
   optimum flow rate of 0.5 mL min(-1). Breakthrough studies showed that
   geosorbent can be effectively used for a long time period of 3000 min.
   Infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy
   dispersive X ray analysis, X ray diffraction spectroscopy, atomic force
   microscopy, Thermogravimetric/differential thermal analysis, surface
   area and zeta potential measurements were performed to characterize the
   structure and properties of the geosorbent. Mechanism analysis revealed
   that Reactive Orange 13 adsorption on the manganese oxide coated alunite
   through electrostatic interaction, complexation and ion exchange. Real
   sample decolorization studies revealed the suggested geosorbent can be
   used as an efficient and economic green sorbent for the removal of
   Reactive Orange 13 from aquatic media with an adsorption yield of
   97.88%. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Textile wastewaters (TW) contain contaminants such as organic matter,
   dyes, sulfate, and many salts. Many methods have been used to remove
   these pollutants and to reduce the environmental impact associated with
   their release into water bodies. In the present study, physically
   activated carbon made of sugar cane bagasse was used as an adsorbent to
   remove color and chemical oxygen demand (COD) from textile effluent. The
   experiments were carried out with a real effluent from a textile jeans
   laundry. The effect of the variables, such as adsorbent amount, pH,
   contact time, temperature, and particle size of the adsorbent, was
   tested. The most efficient results were obtained for the adsorbent mass
   of 0.25 g, pH 6.0, contact time of 60 min, and adsorbent size smaller
   than 0.42 mm. The adsorbent performed well for color removal of textile
   effluent, removing up to 93% and 55% of color and COD, respectively. The
   Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and total pore volume were
   188.2 m(2) g(-1) and 0.13 cm(3) g(-1), respectively, and average sizes
   of pore diameter of 2.7 nm and 3.6 nm. This indicates the ability of
   agro-industrial waste for application in the process of textile

AB BACKGROUNDChemically different types of dyes have been proven to be
   degraded by peroxidases of Phanerochaete chrysosporium. Hydrogen
   peroxide is required as a co-substrate for peroxidases during the
   oxidation process.
   RESULTSInvestigating the effect of glucose oxidase (GOx) (EC 1.1.3.4) on
   treatment of textile effluent containing recalcitrant diazo and azo dyes
   by P. chrysosporium was the main aim of this research. The effects of
   glucose, GOx and Mn2+ on chemical oxygen demand (COD), decolorization
   and manganese peroxidase (MnP) activity were evaluated in repeated batch
   operations. At the end of the fifth batch, the decolorization efficiency
   increased 4.18-fold compared with reference batches (i.e. no additive
   received batches). An increase in MnP activity and COD removal
   percentage by 4.5- and 5-fold, respectively, were observed when
   introducing GOx+glucose.
   CONCLUSIONIn vivo addition of GOx+glucose could increase the
   decolorization efficiency of real sample effluent not only by providing
   H2O2 for catalytic activity of peroxidases but also by providing
   gluconic acid, favoring the pH of the medium and increasing peroxidase
   activity as well. Also, these findings may be useful for discerning the
   role of manganese ions and oxidases of fungi as well as their
   interaction in the decolorization process. (c) 2016 Society of Chemical

   with phosphoric acid. Batch adsorption experiments were conducted to
   study the adsorbent effectiveness in removing a cationic dye, basic
   yellow 28, from an aqueous solution. The effects of adsorbent dosage,
   dye concentration and initial pH on the elimination of the dye were
   analyzed. The results show that the equilibrium data were correctly
   represented using the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The adsorption
   capacity of activated carbon toward the cationic dye was 357.14 mg/g
   obtained at 20 degrees C. The kinetic study indicates that the
   adsorption process of dye on activated carbon follows a
   pseudo-second-order equation. The efficiency of this process was tested
   for real effluent; the adsorbent was able to reduce the concentration of
   total organic carbon.

AB Abstract Textile wastewater is a combination of various chemicals and
   different types of dyes and has a salty nature. In this study, an SBR
   (sequencing batch reactor) was used to treat synthetic and real textile
   wastewaters in a 24 h cycle time. Remazol Brilliant Blue R, a reactive
   dye, was used as the model dye. Dye concentrations ranged from 125mg/L
   to 500mg/L, and TDS (total dissolved solids) concentrations ranged from
   1000 mg/L to 10,000 mg/L in synthetic wastewaters. For the highest dye
   concentration (500 mg/L) with low TDS, an 80.71% COD removal efficiency
   was obtained; at a TDS concentration of 5000 mg/L, a 59.44% COD removal
   efficiency was obtained. When the TDS concentration of wastewater was
   raised to 10,000 mg/L, COD removal decreased to 14.92% and reductions in
   MLSS (mixed liquor suspended solids) and MLVSS (mixed liquor volatile
   suspended solids) concentrations were observed. According to the
   results, increasing the TDS concentration of wastewater up to 5000 mg/L
   did not affect COD removal efficiency of the activated sludge
   microorganisms in the treatment system.

AB Today, polluted environment and wastewater have become the most
   significant subjects of dialogue for every intellectual meeting all
   around the world. Involvement of dyes in the environment has become the
   most dangerous factor for the environment. Polluted water is causing a
   lot of problems for both living organisms and non-living objects.
   Multi-functional and extremely competent progressions based on
   nanotechnology are providing reasonable solutions to detoxification of
   dyes. The aim of this study is to analyse the conceivable methods for
   exclusion of waste products from water. An overview of the accessibility
   of different nanomaterials for visible-light photocatalysis for
   detoxification of dyes has been presented in this review. This paper
   climaxes that semiconductor nanomaterials bargain great potential for
   bringing novel and enhanced remediation tools and technologies to clean
   up the environment. Process, effects, properties, limitation and future
   perspectives of photocatalysis have been reviewed and presented.

AB The removal of toxic compounds (azo dyes) from dyeing wastewater was
   investigated by an environmentally friendly activated carbon produced
   from solid waste generated in the tannery process, the cattle hair
   (CHW), activated with H3PO4 (AC-CHW), suggesting a life cycle extension
   for this material from leather processing. Preliminary tests with
   aqueous solutions containing Acid Brown 414 (AB-414) and Acid Orange 142
   (AO-142) removed 71.06% and 73.05%, respectively. The activated carbon
   was characterized by zeta potential (ZP), functional groups (FTIR),
   elemental composition, sorbent specific surface area, and pore size
   distribution (BET/BJH). The specific surface area showed low values when
   compared to commercial activated carbon, but average pore diameter was
   higher, which facilitates the adsorption of larger and complex
   molecules, such as those present in real wastewaters. Through SEM and
   FTIR, the presence of the toxic compounds studied in the AC-CHW after
   sorption process was observed, where the results indicated that the
   functional groups of -CH=CH- participated in the removal process for
   these compounds. The removal efficiency obtained with AC-CHW was 51.94%
   and 49.73% for the dyeing wastewater containing AB-414 and AO-142,
   respectively. The obtained results open a promising via to use AC-CHW as
   efficient eco-friendly sorbent for the treatment of leather wastewater.

AB The use of biosorbents for the decontamination of industrial effluent
   (e.g., wastewater treatment) by retaining non-biodegradable pollutants
   (antibiotics, dyes, and heavy metals) has been investigated in order to
   develop inexpensive and effective techniques. The exacerbated water
   pollution crisis is a huge threat to the global economy, especially in
   association with the rapid development of industry; thus, the
   sustainable reuse of different treated water resources has become a
   worldwide necessity. This review investigates the use of different
   natural (living and non-living) microbial biomass types containing
   polysaccharides, proteins, and lipids (natural polymers) as biosorbents
   in free and immobilized forms. Microbial biomass immobilization
   performed by using polymeric support (i.e., polysaccharides) would
   ensure the production of efficient biosorbents, with good mechanical
   resistance and easy separation ability, utilized in different effluents'
   depollution. Biomass-based biosorbents, due to their outstanding
   biosorption abilities and good efficiency for effluent treatment
   (concentrated or diluted solutions of residuals/contaminants), need to
   be used in industrial environmental applications, to improve
   environmental sustainability of the economic activities. This review
   presents the most recent advances related the main polymers such as
   polysaccharides and microbial cells used for biosorbents production; a
   detailed analysis of the biosorption capability of algal, bacterial and
   fungal biomass; as well as a series of specific applications for
   retaining metal ions and organic dyes. Even if biosorption offers many
   advantages, the complexity of operation increased by the presence of
   multiple pollutants in real wastewater combined with insufficient
   knowledge on desorption and regeneration capacity of biosorbents (mostly
   used in laboratory scale) requires more large-scale biosorption
   experiments in order to adequately choose a type of biomass but also a
   polymeric support for an efficient treatment process.

AB The aim of the present study was to signify the role of the particle
   size of an iron source in the photo- Fenton system for textile dyeing
   wastewater oxidation. In this respect, a facile synthesis of Fe2O3
   nanoparticles (Fe2O3 NPs) via a simple sol- gel route using FeCl3 with
   different molarities was investigated. The XRD patterns confirmed the
   formation of Fe2O3 nanoparticles. Furthermore, different molar
   concentrations of the FeCl3 precursor significantly influenced the size
   and shape of the nanoparticles. The treatment of wastewater effluents
   containing the reactive dye Procion Blue MX- 7RX from a real textile
   dyeing facility, was investigated using the synthesized Fe2O3 NPs as a
   source of the Fenton's reagent photocatalyst. The reaction was initiated
   and enhanced using an artificial UV source for increasing the cOH
   radical yield. System parameters such as the initial dye load in
   wastewater, H2O2 and Fe2O3 NP concentrations, pH and the working
   temperature were investigated for process optimization. The quality of
   water in this investigation was examined by making measurements of
   chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solids (TSS) and dye
   removal which decreased during the illumination time. The effects of
   different Fe2O3 NPs based on the varying precursor solution molarities
   namely F1, F3, F5 and F7 on the wastewater remediation were
   investigated, and the optimum Fe2O3 NPs were found to be F1, which
   exhibited the highest dye removal value of 83% and a chemical oxygen
   demand (COD) reduction of 88%. Furthermore, the oxidation kinetics of
   the Procion Blue dye were studied, and the data were well fitted with
   the second order kinetics. Finally, the thermodynamic parameters
   including the changes in the Gibbs free energy of activation, entropy of
   activation and enthalpy of activation for the Procion Blue oxidation
   with different Fenton's reagent sources under ultraviolet light
   illustrated that the reaction was non- spontaneous and endothermic.

AB Wastewater from the textile industry containing a high concentration of
   organic and inorganic chemicals have strong color and residual chemical
   oxygen demand (COD). Therefore, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are
   very good candidates to treat textile industry wastewater. In this
   study, we investigated the effect of different types of AOPs supported
   with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on the treatment of viscose fibers dyeing
   wastewater. Fenton, photo-Fenton, and Fenton supported subcritical water
   oxidation (FSWO) processes were chosen as AOPs to compare the treatment
   efficiency of viscose fibers dyeing wastewater. The effects of solution
   pH, Fe2+ concentration, and H2O2 concentration on the treatment of
   viscose fibers dyeing wastewater were tested. The maximum color and COD
   removal efficiency was obtained corresponding to pH 2.5 for all
   oxidation methods when MB dye solution was used. However, the maximum
   efficiencies were obtained at pH 3.0 for real textile wastewater
   decolorization. The MB dye removal efficiency was increased to 97.22,
   100, and 100% for Fenton, photo-Fenton, and FSWO processes,
   respectively, when the addition of H2O2 concentration was adjusted to
   125 mg/L. However, the maximum color removal efficiencies of viscose
   fibers dyeing wastewater were obtained 56.94, 61.26, 64.11% for Fenton,
   photo-Fenton, FSWO processes, respectively. As a result, the FSWO showed
   maximum color removal efficiencies.

AB The Fenton and photochemically stimulated Fenton (photo-Fenton)
   responses are essential because these are especially powerful for the
   deterioration of carcinogenic and toxic compounds in the aqueous
   environment utilizing heterogeneous catalysts. The reason of the current
   investigation was to examine the effectiveness of hydroxyl
   FeAl-intercalated bentonites (FeAl-bent) in Fenton and photo-Fenton
   techniques. Specifically, Fe/Al ratios were of interest as a mean to
   vary the catalytic activity. Intercalation was accomplished by means of
   a particle ion-exchange technique and Congo red (CR) was the model
   compound for degradation by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in Fenton and
   photo-Fenton processes using FeAl-bentonite. Also, the degradation of a
   real textile effluent was done under UV light irradiation. The studied
   catalysts were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, N-2
   adsorption/desorption, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM), and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy. The
   catalytic performance of pillared clay was evaluated by means of
   different experimental conditions, such as the Fe/Al molar ratio of the
   intercalating solution, the catalyst amount, the hydrogen peroxide
   concentration, and the pH. The treatment by Fenton process demonstrated
   that 50% degradation efficiency of Congo red dye was achieved after 240
   min of reaction. But, in photo-Fenton process 100% degradation was
   accomplished after just 60 min. Moreover, pillared clay showed a high
   catalytic activity both for the mineralization of CR and real textile
   effluent and also a high stability.

AB The present study is concerned with the batch adsorption of Congo red
   (CR) from aqueous solutions using Nelumbo nucifera (lotus) leaf powder
   (LLP) adsorbent. Decolorization experiments were conducted in batch mode
   by varying experimental factors such as initial pH, adsorbate
   concentration, adsorbent dosage, particle size and agitation speed. The
   experiments are designed to attain the most optimized system using
   response surface methodology. The maximum adsorption efficiency is
   obtained at an initial pH: 6, adsorbent dosage: 6 g L-1, adsorbent
   particle size: 42 mu m and agitation speed: 150 rpm. The prepared
   adsorbent was characterized by proximate, particle size,
   Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area and pore volume, attenuated
   transmission reflector, field-emission scanning electron
   microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric
   analysis. The zero-point charge of the adsorbent was found to be at pH
   6.2. The isotherm and kinetic rate constants are found using several
   isotherm and kinetic models, respectively. The dye adsorption rate
   follows a pseudo-second-order kinetic model, and the equilibrium data
   fit the Langmuir isotherm model with a maximum monolayer adsorption
   capacity (q(max)) of 45.89 mg g(-1) at 303 K. The adsorption mechanisms
   were described by pore diffusion, Bangham and Boyd plots. The overall
   rate of adsorption is controlled by both film and pore diffusion of dye
   molecules. Based on the thermodynamic analysis, the adsorption was found
   to be endothermic in nature, and the process was chemisorption,
   spontaneous and favored at high temperatures. Desorption studies were
   conducted with various desorbing reagents and the maximum desorption
   efficiency was determined using the solvent methanol. The adsorption of
   solute from real textile industrial CR dye effluent was carried out in
   batch studies using LLP adsorbent. The chemical oxygen demand removal
   efficiency of industrial dye effluent was 67.35%.

AB Textile wastewater, especially when the dyeing section is involved, is
   remarkably polluted, characterized by a high value of chemical oxygen
   demand (COD) and color. The process to treat them currently is mostly
   biochemical and due to the heavy load, the process is remarkably
   expensive or needs a lot of steps. This research is launched in order to
   investigate a new alternative electrochemical compact treatment system
   to treat real textile wastewater with stainless steel, aluminum, and
   Ti/IrO2-RuO2 electrodes. The result showed that after 6 h of treatment
   at the current density of 6.32 mA/cm(2), aluminum was the best electrode
   material, capable of removing 99% color, 70% TSS, and 95.2% COD.
   Ti/IrO2-RuO2 electrode was the next, with respective values of 87.6%
   color, 81.2% TSS, and 79.2% COD removal efficiencies. However, stainless
   steel failed to have a consistent decreasing trend in pollutant
   concentrations, netting down at 32.1% color removal, 51.7% TSS removal,
   and 33% COD removal. The final pH's of the treated waters were 8.304,
   6.81, and 5.19, respectively.

AB Magnesium phyllosilicates with organic groups anchored onto the
   inorganic polymeric backbones as mono-or bifunctional entities were
   investigated for dye removal from aqueous solution. The synthetic
   methodology consisted in obtaining organofunctionalized nanostructured
   materials from silylating agents of general formula R-1-Si(OCH3)(3), in
   which R-1-trimethoxysilane includes chains containing the functional
   groups: 3-aminopropyl, octadecyldimethyl(silylpropyl)ammonium,
   3-mercaptopropyl, 3-ethylenediamine and 3-diethylenetriamine. The
   sol-gel process leads to lamellar structures similar to those of natural
   silicate with basal distances, in good agreement with the R-1 contained
   in the precursor agent. The pendant electrophile attached on the new
   phyllosilicates interacts with the negative charge of dyes used in the
   textile industry, such as Reactive Yellow GR, Reactive Red RB and
   Reactive Blue RN. The sorption studies showed that the phyllosilicate
   containing octadecyldimethyl(3-trimethoxysilylpropyl)ammonium chloride
   agent, P-OCT, presented the highest sorption capacities of 1343, 1286
   and 344 mg g(-1) for the dyes Yellow GR, Blue RN and Red RB,
   respectively, which are better than for other sorbing materials. Real
   samples from textile effluents assayed demonstrated that the sorption
   did not need to adjust the initial pH, with surface saturation after 3 h
   and the minimum mass necessary was 2.5 g dm(-3) of P-OCT for the best
   efficiency. This is thus a very promising material for textile effluent
   treatment, with good structural disposition of the pendant groups.

AB The photocatalytic degradation of indigo carmine (IC) dye in the
   presence of titanium dioxide under different conditions was reported.
   Several factors which interfere with the photodegradation efficiency as
   catalyst concentration, pH, initial concentration of dye, presence of
   inorganic anions, temperature, and the addition of hydrogen peroxide
   were studied under artificial irradiation with a 125 W mercury vapor
   lamp. Additionally, the catalyst supported on glass spheres was used for
   the photocatalytic degradation of the dye present in several types of
   waters in a CPC solar pilot plant. The photocatalytic products,
   carboxylic acids, and SO42- and NH4+ were followed during IC
   mineralization. Formate, acetate, and oxalatewere detected in real MWWTP
   secondary effluent. The mineralization efficiency was of 42 and 21%
   using in suspension and supported TiO2, respectively. In order to
   evaluate biological effects, Eisenia andrei earthworms were used as a
   model organism. No significant difference (P > 0.05) of weight was
   observed in the earthworm submitted to different concentrations of IC
   and its photoproducts. The photocatalytic degradation of IC on TiO2
   supported on glass spheres suffered strong influence of the water
   matrix; nevertheless the method has the enormous advantage that it
   eliminates the need for the final catalyst removal step, reducing
   therefore the cost of treatment.

AB The present study reports significant improvements in the removal of
   ammoniacal nitrogen from wastewater which is an important problem for
   many industries such as dyes and pigment, distilleries and fisheries.
   Pilot plant studies (capacity, 1 m(3)/h) on synthetic wastewater using
   4-amino phenol as model nitrogen containing organic compound and two
   real industrial effluents of high ammoniacal nitrogen content were
   carried out using hydrodynamic cavitation. Two reactor geometries were
   evaluated for increased efficiency in removal-orifice and vortex diode.
   Effect of initial concentration (100-500 mg/L), effect of pressure drop
   (0.5-5 bar) and nature of cavitating device (linear and vortex flow for
   cavitation) were evaluated along with effect of salt content, effect of
   hydrogen peroxide addition and aeration. Initial concentration was found
   to have significant impact on the extent of removal: similar to 5 g/m(3)
   removal for initial concentration of 100 mg/L and up to 12 g/m(3)
   removal at high concentration of 500 mg/L. Interestingly, significant
   improvement of the order of magnitude (up to 8 times) in removal of
   ammoniacal nitrogen could be obtained by sparging air or oxygen in
   hydrodynamic cavitation and a very high removal of above 80% could be
   achieved. The removal of ammoniacal nitrogen by vortex diode was also
   found to be effective in the industrial wastewaters and results on two
   different effluent samples of distillery industry indicated up to 75%
   removal, though with longer time of treatment compared to that of
   synthetic wastewater. The developed methodology of hydrodynamic
   cavitation technology with aeration and vortex diode as a cavitating
   device was found to be highly effective for improving the efficiency of
   the conventional cavitation methods and hence can be highly useful in
   industrial wastewater treatment, specifically for the removal of
   ammoniacal nitrogen.

   lives. The current study deals with the synthesis of nickel oxide
   nanoparticles using Allium cepa peels aqueous extract. Nickel oxide
   nanoparticles (NiO-NPs) were characterized by SEM. Synthesized NiO-NPs
   were used to remove Congo red direct dye. Various experimental factors
   like concentration of dye & nanoparticles, pH, and temperature were
   optimized. Congo red direct dye was decolorized up to 90% at optimized
   conditions (Congo Red Direct dye concentration 0.02%, catalyst dose
   0.003 g center dot L-1, pH 6, and temperature (50 degrees C). The real
   textile industry effluent disclosed 70% decolorization at optimized
   conditions. The percent reduction in TOC and COD were found to be 73.24%
   and 74.56%, in the case of congo red dye catalytic treatment & the
   percent reduction in TOC and COD were found to be 62.47% and 60.23%,
   respectively in the treatment of textile effluent using nickel oxide
   nanoparticles as a catalyst. Treated and untreated dye samples were
   exposed to FTIR and UV-Visible spectral analyses too. The reaction
   products were studied by degradation pathway.

AB The textile industry is one of the largest consumers of water in the
   world and its wastewater is a serious problem when it is discharged
   without the proper treatment. In this work, wastewater generated by
   textile industry was treated coupling a homogenization-decantation
   treatment with polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) ultrafiltration
   membranes.
   Initially, the wastewater was aerated in a homogenization-decantation
   tank where 17% colour and 10% chemical oxygen demand (COD) were removed.
   The aerated effluent was treated with an ultrafiltration membrane in
   order to reuse the permeate in new dyeing processes. Firstly, the
   ultrafiltration treatment was performed in a laboratory plant. The
   permeate analysis showed 20% colour removal and 60% COD decrease. On the
   basis of these results, a semi-industrial system was built. With this
   plant, the permeate characterization showed similar results. The system
   was found to be scalable and suitable for the treatment of this kind of
   effluents.
   Finally, new dyeings were performed with both permeates. Monochromatic
   dyeings were carried out with 100% permeate whereas 50% permeate was
   reused for dyeings with a mixture of three dyes. The colour differences
   were found to be lower than 1.5, which was the acceptance value
   established. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   adsorption studies were conducted to investigate the optimal operating
   conditions including pH, adsorbent dose, contact time and stirring rate
   for the removal of COD, TSS and color from real textile wastewater. At
   same optimal operating conditions, pH 6, dose 0.8 g/L, contact time 20
   min and stirring rate 100 rpm, the experimental results showed
   distinctive removal efficiency by using AC reached to 78.8% for COD,
   76.2% for TSS and 84% for color, while nZVI recorded relatively lower
   removal efficiency reached to 74.7% for COD, 72.6% for TSS and 80% for
   color. A comparison study between nZVI and AC was conducted to evaluate
   the potential of using the two sorbent materials based on technical and
   sustainable criteria using different multi-criteria decision-making
   methods: TOPSIS, AHP and SAW. The study concluded that generally AC is
   better than nZVI based on the established criteria and weights.

AB Many industries use various dyes to beautify their products and
   discharge the waste into the water without proper treatment. Such
   wastewater is not only dangerous for aquatic life but it is also toxic
   to human life and can cause numerous problems, such as skin diseases,
   and some dyes are carcinogenic or even mutagenic as well. Rhodamine-B
   (RhB) is one of those synthetic organic dyes which is widely used in
   textile, paper making, leather manufacturing, stained glass work,
   cosmetics, and many other industries owing to its high tinting strength,
   high stability, and bright colour. Therefore, it is essential to either
   remove or reduce its concentration before releasing it into aquatic
   streams, as well as to minimize or control the cause of several
   diseases. Several physical and chemical methods have been used for the
   removal of different dyes from wastewater; nevertheless, adsorption is
   one of the best techniques used for the removal of dyes due to its high
   efficiency and low cost. In this regard, we used Chamaecyparis
   lawsoniana (C. lawsoniana) fruit as a bio-adsorbent for the removal of
   RhB from an aqueous solution. An 85.42% dye adsorption was achieved at
   optimized conditions (pH 2, 40 ppm initial dye concentration, 105 min,
   and 50 mg adsorbent). Adsorption occurs by pseudo-second-order kinetics,
   according to kinetic studies. Several samples from various sources,
   including tap water, distilled water, river water, and filtered river
   water, were tested for RhB removal, and the study revealed good results
   even in river water. Thus, C. lawsoniana fruit can be used for its
   real-world application.

AB In this work, the treatment of synthetic wastewaters containing Novacron
   Blue C-D (NB) by anodic oxidation (AO) using boron-doped diamond (BDD)
   and platinum (Pt) anodes was investigated. Galvanostatic electrolyses of
   NB synthetic wastewaters have led to the complete decolourisation
   removal at different operating conditions (current density and
   temperature). The influence of these parameters was investigated in
   order to find the best conditions for dyestuff colour removal. According
   to the experimental results obtained, the AO process is suitable for
   decolourising wastewaters containing these textile dyes, due to the
   electrocatalytic properties of BDD and Pt anodes. Energy requirements
   for removing colour during galvanostatic electrolyses of NB synthetic
   solution depends mainly on the operating conditions: for example, it
   passes from 14.53 Wh m(-3) at 20 mA cm(-2) to 60.75 Wh m(-3) at 60 mA
   cm(-2) (pH 8) (data estimated per volume of treated effluent) using BDD
   anodes. In order to verify the Brazilian law regulations of NB synthetic
   solutions after electrochemical decolourisation treatment, the Hazen
   units (HU) values were determined and the total colour removal was
   achieved; remaining into the regulations. Also, electrical energy cost
   for removing colour was estimated. Finally, AO process was tested to

AB Surgical cotton production has drastically been increased in the past
   few years due to excessive use by medical health professionals
   especially in countries like India, which is among the top three
   exporters of cotton worldwide. The effluent generated from surgical
   cotton industries differ from textile effluents by the conspicuous
   absence of dyeing chemicals. This wastewater has a high concentration of
   suspended particles, COD, dissolved ions, organic carbon, and alkaline
   pH. Several studies have been published on the treatment of textile
   effluents and the degradation of dyeing chemicals, while the treatment
   studies on surgical cotton wastewater have been rarely reported in spite
   of their potential to cause pollution in receiving land/water bodies.
   Activated sludge microbes have been extensively studied and well
   documented in the treatment of several industrial effluent but does not
   match to the production of valuable biomass from algae. The global
   energy demand has prompted the scientific community to investigate and
   explore the possibility of using algae for energy production with
   simultaneous wastewater treatment. To the best of the authors'
   knowledge, no research articles have been published which compare the
   effectiveness of activated sludge microorganisms, microalgae, and
   macroalgae in removing contaminants from real wastewater. To date, there
   is a knowledge gap in understanding and selecting the right choice of
   biological system for effective and economical effluent treatment. In an
   attempt to minimize this gap, carbon removal by microalgae, macroalgae,
   and activated sludge microbes were investigated on real effluent from
   surgical cotton industries. It was observed that the strain of Chlorella
   vulgaris could dissipate 83% of COD from real wastewater, while
   consortia of macroalgae (consisting predominantly of Ulvaceae and
   Chaetomorpha) and activated sludge microbes could remove 81% and 69% of
   the carbon, respectively. The microalgal growth (in terms of wet weight)
   increased from 0.15 to 0.3 g, whereas the macroalgal wet weight
   increased from 1.5 to 3 g in over 7 days of batch experiments conducted
   in triplicates. This indicated the superlative performance of microalgae
   over activated sludge microbes in carbon dissipation.

AB The aim of this work was an experimental and theoretical investigation
   of the influence of electrolyte (NaCl) and surfactant (SP), as textile
   auxiliary agents (TAAs), onto reactive blue 5G (RB5G) dye removal by
   applying untreated fish scales (FS) in batch system. Kinetic and
   equilibrium studies were performed, aiming at the comprehension of the
   mass transfer mechanisms through phenomenological modeling. The
   biosorbent was texturally characterized, to investigate the adsorbent's
   characteristics and to support the models' assumptions. Hence, a
   physically meaningful' modeling to assess different systems containing
   dye-TAA mixtures was employed. The experimental results indicated that
   despite the FS nonporous characteristics, it showed remarkable
   adsorption capacities (approximate to 291 mg g-1), which may be ascribed
   to the adsorbent-adsorbate affinity and to dye-aggregates adsorption
   onto the FS surface. Those results evidence a potential use of FS as an
   alternative biosorbent material. The mathematical model was able to
   identify the rate-limiting step of the process; to predict the
   adsorption kinetics and equilibrium condition, comprising the
   description of aggregates formation; and to successfully predict kinetic
   behavior of independent data in simulated real effluent. Those results
   indicate that the model can be used to simulate operating conditions

AB This work describes the application of a solid-liquid two-phase
   partitioning bioreactor (TPPB) for the removal of colour from a real
   textile wastewater containing reactive azo-dyes. Four polymers were
   tested over the pH range of 4-9 to select the most effective absorbant
   to be used as the partitioning phase in the TPPB. The best results were
   obtained with Hytrel 8206 at pH 4 achieving similar to 70% colour
   removal, based on the dominant wavelength, in the first 5 h of contact
   time, and 84% after 24 h. Wastewater treatment was undertaken in a
   solid-liquid TPPB operated with Hytrel 8206 in sequential
   anaerobic-aerobic configuration. The reaction time of 23 h was equally
   distributed between the anaerobic and aerobic phases and, to favour
   colour uptake, the pH was controlled at 4.5 in the first 4 h of the
   anaerobic phase, and then-increased to 7.5. Colour removal (for the
   dominant wavelength, 536 nm) increased from 70 to 85% by modifying the
   bioreactor operation from single-phase to TPPB mode. Based on COD
   measurements nearly complete" biodegradation of the intermediates
   produced in the anaerobic phase was obtained, both in the single-phase
   and two-phase mode, with better performance of the TPPB system reaching
   75% CODoye removal. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Adsorption of copper ions onto chitosan films was studied, and the
   matrix effect was evaluated using a synthetic solution and a real
   effluent from closed copper mine. Chitosan films were prepared by
   casting technique and characterized. The adsorption study was carried
   out by equilibrium isotherms, thermodynamics, and kinetics. The
   thermodynamic parameters indicated that the copper adsorption onto
   chitosan film was favorable, spontaneous, and exothermic, suggesting an
   increased randomness at the solid/solution interface. The matrix effect
   was evaluated in kinetic assays, where a synthetic solution and a real
   system were carried out at different stirring rates. The highest values
   of adsorption capacity reached in all stirring rates were about 20%
   lower in the real effluent, and this reduction in the competitiveness
   was due to the presence of other ions in the matrix of the real
   effluent. The maximum adsorption capacity of copper ions onto chitosan
   films for the synthetic solution was of 450 mg g(-1), and the removal
   percentage was in the range from 78 to 96%, and these values for the
   real effluent were of 360 mg g(-1) and removal ranging from 62 to 76%.
   The mapping done of ions present in the water adsorbed of the mine in
   the films showed that the same was homogeneously distributed in the
   films' surfaces.

AB Reactive Black 5, RB5, has been used as a model azo dye to evaluate the
   removal efficiency of sorption on Macrocystis pyrifera biomass (Mpyr)
   and commercial zerovalent iron nanoparticles (nZVI) in individual and
   combined treatments. The best conditions for the treatment with the
   isolated materials were first determined, and then, in series and
   combined treatments were performed under these conditions, achieving
   removal efficiencies higher than 80% of the initial dye concentration.
   Strengths and weaknesses of all removal strategies (individual, in
   series and combined) are analyzed regarding the application on real
   effluents. Mpyr efficiently adsorbed RB5, but also increased the total
   organic content by partial dissolution of components of the algal
   biomass. Removal experiments with commercial nZVI were also efficient
   but liberated Fe to the solution, and sulfanilic acid was observed after
   the treatment as a product of RB5 degradation. In contrast, after the
   Mpyr treatment, no sulfanilic acid was detected, suggesting that
   sulfanilic acid is efficiently adsorbed by the biomass. The best
   condition was the integrated use of Mpyr and nZVI, with a remarkable
   removal efficiency (69-80%) obtained after only 1 h of treatment.
   Finally, nZVI were successfully immobilized in Mpyr, and the hybrid
   material was used to remove RB5 in continuous flow experiments at pH 3,
   obtaining a removal capacity of 39.9 mg RB5 g(-1) after a total
   processed volume of 630 mL of [RB5](0) = 100 mg L-1. (C) 2017 Elsevier

AB In this study, Bacillus cereus isolate from tannery effluent was
   employed for orange II dye decolorization in simulated minimal salt
   broth and textile effluent. Most of the physicochemical parameters of
   textile effluent were above the permissible limits. The strain was
   highly tolerant to dye up to 500 mg l(-1). Increasing dye concentration
   exerted inhibitory effect on the bacterial growth and decolorization.
   The maximum decolorization of initial 100 mg dye l(-1) was achieved at
   optimum pH 8.0 and 33 A degrees C under static culture conditions during
   96-h incubation. Supplementation with optimized glucose (0.4 %, w/v) and
   ammonium sulfate (0.1 %, w/v) with 3.0 % B. cereus inoculum further
   enhanced dye decolorization to highest 68.5 % within 96-h incubation. A
   direct correlation was evident between bacterial growth and dye
   decolorization. Under above optimized conditions, 24.3 % decolorization
   of unsterilized real textile effluent by native microflora was achieved.
   The effluent decolorization enhanced substantially to 37.1 % with B.
   cereus augmentation and to 40.5 % when supplemented with glucose and
   ammonium sulfate without augmentation. The maximum decolorization of
   52.5 % occurred when textile effluent was supplemented with optimized
   exogenous carbon and nitrogen sources along with B. cereus augmentation.
   Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry identified sulfanilic acid as
   orange II degradation product. Fourier transform infra red spectroscopy
   of metabolic products indicated the presence of amino and hydroxyl
   functional groups. This strain may be suitably employed for in situ
   decolorization of textile industrial effluent under broad environmental
   conditions.

AB The textile industry widely uses reactive dyes to obtain cotton fabrics
   having good resistance to color removal despite frequent washing. This
   level of dye usage generates substantial volumes of wastewater
   containing significant quantities of residual dye requiring treatment
   before discharges from commercial dyeing operations to public waterways.
   As part of a study aimed at recycling/reusing rather than discharging
   reactive dye wastewater, well-known dyes Reactive Yellow 176, Reactive
   Red 241, and Reactive Blue 221 were used in dyeing cotton fabric, and
   the generated wastewater samples were decolorized with H2O2 catalyzed by
   UV light. The efficiency of UV/H2O2 decolorization for trichromic
   wastewater was determined by UV-Vis monitoring at 550 nm, wherein it was
   found that more than 91% of color removal in trichromic wastewater
   occurred at pH 4. The reuse of wastewater was investigated by a total of
   three sequential cycles of wastewater treatments. The quality of cotton
   dyed with reused wastewater was assessed through color measurements
   using CIELAB, fastness to light, and wash fastness testing. Results
   showed that MCT/VS-based reactive dye wastewater arising from UV/ H2O2
   treatment could be used for two subsequent dyeing cycles without
   compromising the quality of the color of the dyed cotton fabrics. The
   proposed treatment can also save water and salt, enhancing the economy
   of the dyeing process.

AB Textile industry effluents contain a variety of dyes, which are normally
   resistant to biodegradation. A bacterial-yeast consortium (Brevibacillus
   laterosporus and Galactomyces geotrichum) was used for decolorization of
   two real textile effluents (RTE) and a simulated synthetic effluent
   (SSE). It showed enhanced decolorization compared to that of individual
   microorganisms with decolorization efficiency of 89, 60 and 69% for
   RTE-1, RTE-2 and SSE respectively, within 48 h. The cumulative action of
   oxido-reductive enzyme in the consortium was responsible for improved
   decolorization. Spectroscopic analysis suggested effective
   biodegradation of dyes present in the SSE by the consortium contrarily
   to the individual strains. The gradual biodegradation of each dye
   present in the SSE was monitored using high performance thin layer
   chromatography (HPTLC). The consortium biodegraded all of the dyes
   within 1 has compared to that of partial biodegradation by the
   individual microorganisms. A novel, triple layered fixed bed reactor was
   designed for continuous decolorization of effluent. It showed >80%
   decolorization (at 100 mL h(-1) flow-rate), for a period of 7 days,
   along with 78% reduction in COD. The reproducibility of the bioreactor
   could be maintained for three consecutive cycles (7 days each). (C) 2016

AB A new adsorbent from Jeriva coconut (a fruit native to the Atlantic

   H3PO4. The characterization of activated carbon using SEM-EDS revealed
   an irregular and heterogeneous surface, with a surface area of 750 m(2)
   g(-1), while FTIR indicated the presence of functional groups. The
   adsorption kinetics was favorable, reaching equilibrium in 80 min,
   removing more than 99% of the initial concentration (100 mg L-1) of
   methylene blue; the Avrami model had a better fit to the data. The
   sorption isotherms performed at four temperatures showed endothermic
   behavior, with a maximum adsorption capacity of 254.40 mg g(-1), with
   adjustment to the Sips model. The mechanisms involved in dye adsorption
   were discussed and elucidated. The adsorbent was tested to remove the
   color of the real effluent from the textile industry, and the results
   showed discoloration superior to 93%, meeting international disposal
   limits. The results confirm the efficiency of the new adsorbent and the
   possibility of application in the treatment of textile effluents.

   photolysis, is a promising technique for removing color and chemical
   oxygen demand (COD) from effluents. Crucially, the combination of
   electrochemical and photochemical techniques leads to lower quantities
   of chlorine-containing degradation by-products being produced and no

AB A photo-Fenton process using a local iron oxide as a natural catalyst
   was compared to Fenton and UV/H2O2 advanced oxidation processes for
   degrading crystal violet (CV) dye in aqueous solutions. The catalyst was
   characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy
   dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDX), Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy (FT-IR), Raman spectrum, X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-vis
   spectroscopy, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis. The optical
   properties proved that the catalyst represents a good candidate for
   photocatalytic activity. The impact of different parameters (catalyst
   dose, initial CV concentration, initial H2O2 concentration, pH) on the
   photo-Fenton efficiency was evaluated. A photo-Fenton process operated
   under UVC light irradiation, at spontaneous pH, with 1.0 g/L of catalyst
   and 30 mg/L of H2O2 was the most effective process, resulting in 98% CV
   dye removal within 3 h. LC-MS and ion-chromatography techniques were
   used to identify demethylated organic intermediates during the process.
   Furthermore, a regeneration study of the catalyst showed its stability
   and reusability (after three treatment cycles, CV dye degradation
   decreased from 94% to 83%). Finally, the photo-Fenton process was tested
   in the treatment of real textile wastewater, and the effluent was found
   to be in compliance with standards for industrial wastewater disposal

   pollutants, such as dispersants, leveling agents, salts, carriers,
   acids, alkali, and various dyes. The wastewater quality is variable and
   depends on the kind of process that generates the effluent. In addition,
   color is the first recognizable pollutant, which has a negative effect
   on the ecosystem. Many methods are available for removing the
   contaminant; among the various methods, adsorption is significantly
   important and is the major method adopted in chemical and process
   industries. In recent times, there has been a drastic increase in the
   use of various types of charcoals as adsorbent. This review article
   focuses on textile wastewater; adsorption; preparation of charcoals and
   its activated forms using various materials; and treatment of textile
   wastewater using various types of charcoals. Treatment of real and
   synthesized wastewater (i.e., dye solution) is included and a
   feasibility study of utilizing charcoal is performed by comparing
   adsorption capacities or percentage removal.

AB Real textile wastewater containing high salinity (up to 12.6 g.kg(-1))
   and surfactant (up to 5.9 mg.L-1 of linear alkylbenzene sulfonate - LAS)
   was submitted to biological treatment for colour (up to 652 mg
   Pt-Co.L-1) and sulphate (up to 1,568.6 mg SO4-2.L-1) removal. The
   influence of ethanol and molasses supplementation was firstly evaluated
   in anaerobic batch reactors for the removal of dyes and sulphate.
   Subsequently, aiming to remove aromatic amines (dye degradation
   by-products), an anaerobic-aerobic continuous system supplemented with
   molasses was applied. Supplementation had no influence on colour removal
   (maximum efficiencies around 70%), while it improved sulphate reduction
   (23% without supplementation against 87% with supplementation), and
   conferred robustness to the reactors, which recovered fast after higher
   salinity impact. The aerobic reactor removed aromatic amines when the
   level of surfactants was lower than 1.0 mg LAS.L-1, but the performance
   of the system was hindered when concentration increased to 5.9 mg
   LAS.L-1. Findings suggest that the supplementation of an easily
   biodegradable organic matter might be a strategy to overcome wastewater
   fluctuation in composition.

AB This study aims to evaluate the adsorption properties of cationic and
   anionic dyes from aqueous solution and the treatment of a real textile
   wastewater by H3PO4 and H3BO3 activated Thapsia transtagana stems (TTS).
   Textural properties of adsorbents were observed by scanning electron
   microscopy with an energy dispersive X-ray. The crystalline structure
   was studied by X-ray diffraction and the surface chemistry was
   investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, point of zero
   charge, and potentiometric titrations. Batch adsorption experiments were
   established to evaluate the influence of solution pH, adsorbent dose,
   contact time, temperature, and initial dyes concentration. Maximum
   adsorption occurred at neutral to basic pH values for cationic dyes and
   neutral to acid pH for anionic dyes. The adsorption capacities were
   higher in the case of H3PO4 activation compared to H3BO3 activation.
   Kinetic data were properly fitted with the pseudo-second-order model
   instead of pseudo-first-order model. Equilibrium uptake increased with
   an increase in the initial dye concentration according to Langmuir
   model. The process was exothermic in nature and accompanied by a
   decrease in entropy. Desorption studies of MB indicate that 0.1 N H2SO4
   exhibits higher elution efficiency; 82.89% for AC-H3PO4 and 60.41% for
   AC-H3BO3. The optimum COD removal efficiencies in the real textile
   wastewater were, 69.56% and 56.20%, respectively, for H3PO4 and H3BO3
   activated TTS at solution pH of 4.

   P. Karsten MUT 3060, was tested in different culture conditions to
   assess its real potential for bioremediation of textile wastewaters in
   terms of both decolourisation and detoxification. The fungus efficiently
   decolourised (colour removal up to 96%) four simulated wastewaters that
   mimic the recalcitrance of real ones for pH values, concentration of
   dyes, additives and salts. In the culture condition with the lowest N
   content, the decolourisation was coupled with an important
   detoxification of two simulated effluents, underlining the important
   influence of the cultural medium composition not only on the degradation
   but also on the detoxification of industrial wastes. In the other cases,
   despite an extensive decolourisation, no detoxification was observed.
   The fungus was further tested against a real effluent, collected from a
   wastewater treatment plant before and after the tertiary treatment
   (ozonation) to compare the two technologies in terms of chemical and
   toxicological parameters. The fungal treatment, although less efficient
   than ozonation, caused a good decolourisation of the effluent, with
   colour values within the threshold limits of the Italian law; both the
   fungal and the ozone treatment caused a detoxification, but only towards
   one of the three organisms used for the ecotoxicological tests. These
   results underline the crucial importance of the ecotoxicological
   analysis in assessing the applicability of a wastewater treatment.

AB Several industries utilize synthetic dyes to color their products,
   resulting in generation of wastewater containing strong-colored
   organics. The discharge of these toxic dyes into effluents has adverse
   effects both on human being and aquatic ecosystem. As a result, it is
   important to eliminate these dyes prior to discharge of wastewater into
   the aquatic system. Polyaniline (PANI) based novel nanocomposites are
   gaining popularity due to the tunable electrical conductivity, high
   surface area, eco-friendly nature, which illustrate PANI based
   nanocomposites as suitable materials for wastewater amputation. Thus in
   this research, a novel nanocomposite comprising of magnesium ferrite and
   PANI (MgFe2O4-PANI-NC) was successfully prepared and used for adsorptive
   elimination of methyl red (MR) dye from water. The developed
   nanocomposite could efficiently remove the methyl red (MR) dye from
   water at solution pH of 7.0 which is advantageous for safe disposal of
   treated effluent without further treatment. The highest MR dye uptake
   efficiency of 90.23(+/- 1.55)% was achieved at initial MR dye
   concentration of 50 mg/L, MgFe2O4-PANI-NC dose of 1.0 g/L, and contact
   time of 30 min. The experimental data follow the pseudo-second-order
   kinetic model accurately and isotherm modeling reveals the adsorption of
   MR dye onto the MgFe2O4-PANI-NC follows Langmuir model with maximum dye
   uptake capacity of 98.04 mg/g. The cost analysis revealed that the
   fabrication cost of MgFe2O4-PANI-NC is around $100.60/kg. After 5(th)
   consecutive cycle of repetitive use, the removal efficiency of MR dye
   drops from 90.23(+/- 2.02) % to 80.52(+/- 1.39) % which shows the high
   stability and reusable characteristics MgFe2O4-PANI-NC for real field
   application.

   the removal of salt and reactive dye by varying different variables such
   as pressure, temperature, pH, dye concentration and salt concentration.
   The significant level of both the main effects and the interaction were
   observed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) approach. Based on the
   statistical analysis, the results have provided valuable information on
   the relationship between these variables and the performances of
   membrane. The rejection of salt was found to be greatly influenced by
   pressure, pH and salt concentration whereas the dye rejection was
   relatively constant in between 96.22 and 99.43% regardless of the
   changes in the variables. The water flux on the other hand was found to
   be affected by the pressure and salt concentration. It is also found
   that the model predictions were in good agreement with the experimental
   data, indicating the validity of these models in predicting membrane
   performances prior to the real filtration process.

AB Treatment of real effluents from industries using AOPs stands to be an
   imperative task of crucial importance yet quite huge a challenge largely
   given the nature of complexity of these wastewaters. The present work
   sought to develop a versatile system aimed at the treatment of real
   wastewater using a bubbling annular reactor, which enables us to test
   the efficiency of photolysis; photocatalysis, photo-electrocatalysis and
   direct ozonation using oxygen or ozone as gas flow. A TiO2 nanotubes
   electrode was used as photocatalyst in photocatalytic and
   photoelectrocatalytic measurements with and without coupling with
   ozonation under pH 3.0 and pH 8.0 leading to 50% of color removal after
   60 min reaction. However, the results indicated 90% of color removal
   upon the bubbling of ozone after 15 min of treatment. A synergistic
   effect was observed in all experiments using the AOPs in the presence of
   ozone under both pH values. Interestingly though, 85% of decolorization
   was obtained through direct ozonation without any change in the effluent
   following 10 min of treatment. The results were discussed in terms of
   electric energy per order and were compared to those reported
   previously. For real textile wastewater, ozonation appears to be a
   promising candidate for full-scale effluent decolorization. (C) 2016

   faecalis R1107 within 48 h when the concentration of azo dyes increased
   up to 1000 mg/L. FTIR analysis confirmed that E. faecalis R1107 could
   effectively break down the chemical structures of three azo dyes. E.
   faecalis R1107 alleviated the phytotoxicity of azo dyes and improved
   seed germination, which contributed to the increase in the lengths of
   roots, stems, and leaves of Vigna radiata seedlings. Transcriptomic
   analysis suggested that the gene regulatory networks in E. faecalis
   R1107 synergistically improved the degradation and detoxification of
   RB5, including the major metabolic pathways, the secondary metabolism,
   the transport system, the amino acid metabolic pathways, and the signal
   transduction systems. Simulated textile effluent (STE) was used to mimic
   real textile effluent to evaluate the bioremediation potential of E.
   faecalis R1107, and 72.79% STE can be decolorized after E. faecalis
   R1107 treatment for 48 h. In summary, our study demonstrated that E.

AB The aim of the present study is to investigate the potential of
   electrolytic process on textile dyebath dump wastewater (sulfate
   concentration similar to 30g/L) collected from the cotton fabric dyeing
   process to remove color and COD concentration. Four different electrode
   combinations were tested i.e. stainless steel-stainless steel,
   iron-iron, aluminum-aluminum, and iron (anode)-aluminum (cathode) for
   best removal efficiency and minimum power consumption along with sludge
   generation rate. The significant process parameters (voltage/current
   density and treatment time) were optimized for real industrial
   wastewater using response surface methodology approach. COD removal
   efficiency and color removal efficiency were taken as two responses. The
   best electrode combination was Fe-Al to achieve 75% COD removal
   efficiency and 91% color removal efficiency. The optimized process
   conditions are 7.6V (1242A/m(2)) and 14min treatment time consuming
   59kWh/kg of COD removal with sludge generation rate of 24.1g/L.

AB The real-time textile dyes wastewater contains hazardous and
   recalcitrant chemicals that are difficult to degrade by conventional
   methods. Such pollutants, when released without proper treatment into
   the environment, impact water quality and usage. Hence, the textile dye
   effluent is considered a severe environmental pollutant. It contains
   mixed contaminants like dyes, sodium bicarbonate, acetic acid. The
   physico-chemical treatment of these wastewaters produces a large amount
   of sludge and costly. Acceptance of technology by the industry mandates
   that it should be efficient, cost-effective and the treated water is
   safe for reuse. A sequential anaerobic-aerobic plant-microbe system with
   acclimatized microorganisms and vetiver plants, was evaluated at a
   pilot-scale on site. At the end of the sequential process,
   decolorization and total aromatic amine (TAA) removal were 78.8% and
   69.2% respectively. Analysis of the treated water at various stages
   using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), High Performance Liquid
   Chromatography (HPLC)) Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS)
   Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) indicated that the dyes
   were decolourized and the aromatic amine intermediates formed were
   degraded to give aliphatic compounds. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)
   and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) analysis showed interaction of microbe
   with the roots of vetiver plants. Toxicity analysis with zebrafish
   indicated the removal of toxins and teratogens.

AB Textile wastewater (TW) contains toxic pollutants that pose both
   environmental and human health risks. Reportedly, some of these
   pollutants, including NO3,- NO2- and reactive black 5 (RB-5) dye, can be
   removed via hydrogen-based denitrification (HD); however, it is still
   unclear how different factors affect their simultaneous removal. This
   study aimed to investigate the effect of H-2 flow rate, the sparging
   cycle of air and H-2, and initial dye concentration on the TW treatment
   process. Thus, two reactors, an anaerobic HD reactor and a combined
   aerobic/anaerobic HD reactor, were used to investigate the treatment
   performance. The results obtained that increasing the H-2 flow rate in
   the anaerobic HD reactor increased nitrogen removal and decolorization
   removal rates. Further, increasing the time for anaerobic treatment
   significantly enhanced the pollutant removal rate in the combined
   reactor. Furthermore, an increase in initial dye concentration resulted
   in lower nitrogen removal rates. Additionally, some of the dye was
   decolorized during the HD process via bacterial degradation, and
   increasing the initial dye concentration resulted in a decrease in the
   decolorization rate. Bacterial communities, including Xanthomonadaceae,
   Rhodocyclaceae, and Thauera spp., are presented as the microbial species
   that play a key role in the mechanisms related to nitrogen removal and
   RB-5 decolorization under both HD conditions. However, both reactors
   showed similar treatment efficiencies; hence, based on these results,
   the use of a combined aerobic/anaerobic HD system should be used to
   reduce organic/inorganic pollutant contents in real textile wastewater
   before discharging is recommended.

AB A novel pilot-scale hydrodynamic cavitation (HC) reactor was used to
   decolorize industrial-grade dye solutions and printing ink wastewater
   (PIW). The effect of the orifice plate geometry (1 hole plate of 1 mm
   and 2 mm in diameter, 31 holes of 1 mm and 2 mm in diameter, 62 holes of
   1 mm and 2 mm in diameter), inlet pressure (4, 5 bar), initial dye
   concentration (0.3 and 0.6 OD), and the synergistic effect of HC and
   hydrogen peroxide concentration (0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 g/L) were
   investigated. The results showed that the highest color removal was
   obtained using 31 holes orifice plate of 2 mm holes' diameter, at 4 bar
   inlet pressure. Furthermore, although HC could not degrade completely
   all the industrial-grade dyes, efficiency was enhanced in the presence
   of H2O2. The optimum concentration of hydrogen peroxide was 1.0 g/L
   regardless of the initial concentration of the dyes studied. Under
   optimum operating conditions, color removal reached up to 68% for black,
   39% for red, 43% for yellow, 55% for green, and 51% for cyan dye, while
   color removal in the PIW reached only 15%. The black dye solution
   presented almost 100% COD removal, while 38%, 25%, 67%, and 78% COD
   removal values were obtained for the red, yellow, cyan and green dyes,
   respectively. 55% COD removal was recorded from the PIW. Concerning
   cavitation yields, black, red, yellow, green, cyan dye yields reached
   2.5E(-7), 1.1E(-7), 1.5E(-7), 2.0E (-7), 1.7E(-7) OD.L/J, respectively,
   while PIW yield was 6.3E(-8) OD.L/J. The present study demonstrates that
   HC combined with green oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide could be an
   alternative treatment approach for real industrial wastewater streams.
   However, a combination with a post-treatment method should be applied to
   maximize both color and COD removal.

AB Activated carbons were prepared from the stem parts of Achyranthes
   aspera and Allamanda blanchetii plants and were investigated as
   adsorbents for the removal of malachite green dye from contaminated
   water. Various extraction conditions such as pH, initial concentration
   of dye, adsorbent dosage, temperature, agitation time and presence of
   co-ions were optimized for the maximum possible extraction of the dye.
   For analyzing the combined effect of these parameters on the removal
   efficiency of the adsorbents, statistical optimization modelling was
   adopted. The adsorbents developed were characterized and the adsorption
   abilities were observed to be 40.0 mg/g and 53.0 mg/g for the active
   carbons of Achyranthes aspera and Allamanda blanchetii plants
   respectively. The mechanism of adsorption was studied using various
   isotherm models and it was found that the Freundlich model describes
   well the adsorption process. Thermodynamic studies revealed the
   endothermic and spontaneous nature of physisorption. The kinetics of
   adsorption were well defined by the pseudo-secondorder model. Desorption
   and regeneration studies of the spent adsorbents indicated that the
   percentage of extraction has not come down below 80.0% even after five
   regenerations for both the adsorbents. The validity of the methods
   developed are tested with real dye-polluted industrial effluent samples.

AB The efficacy of a photo-assisted electrochemical oxidation for the
   mineralization of real textile effluents (wash water and dye-bath
   effluent) was investigated by employing a non-photoactive dimensionally
   stable anode in a tubular flow cell. Under optimized conditions, the
   photo-assisted electrochemical oxidation was performed at a pH of 2,
   with a chloride concentration of 2 g L-1, a current density of 10 mA
   cm(-2), and a flow rate of 50 mL min(-1). The process efficiency was
   assessed through ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, high performance
   liquid chromatography, Fourier transform-Infra red spectroscopy, nuclear
   magnetic resonance spectroscopy, chemical oxygen demand and total
   organic carbon analyses. The results obtained have shown that, in case
   of wash water effluent, 96% of chemical oxygen demand and 68% of total
   organic carbon were removed in 180 min of photo-assisted electrochemical
   oxidation, whereas a simple electrochemical oxidation removed only 70%
   of chemical oxygen demand and 27% of total organic carbon, in the same
   time. The energy consumptions were about to 29.8 and 39.5 Wh g(-1), of
   chemical oxygen demand in photo-assisted electrochemical oxidation and
   electrochemical oxidation. The higher efficiency of photo-assisted
   electrochemical oxidation is attributed to the formation of oxychloride
   radicals at acidic pH, as confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance
   analysis. The analytical results revealed that the degradation mechanism
   of photo-assisted electrochemical oxidation is entirely different from
   that of electrochemical oxidation; in particular, the byproducts formed
   in the photo-assisted process are free from chlorinated organic
   compounds and exhibit zero toxicity towards Lemna minor. The
   photo-assisted electrochemical oxidation proved to be effective also in
   the case of dye bath effluents with a high organic load: about 90% of
   the chemical oxygen demand was removed within 5 h at 10 mA cm(-1). The
   recovered salts from the color-free dye-bath effluent were recycled for
   further dyeing purposes. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) are emerging pollutants
   causing serious challenges to wastewater treatment plants due to poor
   biodegradability. In this study, the enhanced removal of highly
   recalcitrant and commonly monitored PhACs, carbamazepine (CBZ) and
   diclofenac (DCF) by heterogeneous photocatalysis was investigated using
   5% Ag2O/P-25 photocatalyst. The photocatalyst was characterized by
   scanning electron microscope (SEM-EDX), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET),
   Fourier transfer infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and UV-vis diffuse
   reflectance spectra (UV-DRS). The effects of catalyst dose, initial
   pollutants concentration, and mineralization during the photocatalytic
   degradation of PhACs were investigated. The matrix effect was assessed
   in deionized water (DW) and real membrane bioreactor effluent (RME).
   Optimal CBZ and DCF removals of 89.10% and 93.5%, respectively for 180
   min of UV irradiation were achieved at catalyst dosage of 0.4 g L-1 in
   DW matrix. However, the optimal catalyst dosages for CBZ and DCF in RME
   matrix were increased by factor 2 and 1.5, respectively, to achieve the
   same degree of removal. Declining trends of removal rate were observed
   when initial concentrations of both the PhACs were increased under
   optimal catalyst dosages, and kinetics seem to fit the
   Langmuir-Hinshelwood model. Photo-induced holes and (OH)-O-center dot
   were the dominant oxidation species involved in the photocatalytic
   degradation of the PhACs. A plausible reusability of 5% Ag2O/P-25
   photocatalyst was observed for both the PhACs. Moreover, various
   aromatic/aliphatic intermediates generated during the photodegradation
   CBZ were identified using fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance
   (FT-ICR) mass spectrometry, and a possible multi-step degradation
   pathway was proposed. Overall, the removal of PhACs using 5% Ag2O/P-25
   photocatalyst showed promising results in real wastewater.

   morphology, consequent shifting of bandgap energy and adequate
   photocatalytic activities under visible range of light. Mg-doped TiO2
   polyscales were investigated for their efficiencies in the degradation
   of most commonly used industrial dyes in the real-time textile
   wastewater. Mg-doped TiO2 polyscales showed excellent photocatalytic
   degradation efficiency in both model industrial dyes (65-95%) and

   thousands of tons of dye wastewater. The heterogeneous catalyst TiO2 in
   the solid state employed in the liquid phase reaction mixture with dye
   and potassium permanganate was recovered and reused several times for
   reproducible results. The kinetics were examined at various operational
   parameters like the effect of dyes, the effect of oxidants, the amount
   of catalysts, and the effect of acids, temperature, and various organic
   and inorganic additives used in the textile industry. The kinetics of
   advanced oxidation and the mechanism of dye de-coloration and
   degradation were monitored using the Congo red (CR) dye as a model in an
   aqueous medium and then applied to other dyes and real dye wastewater
   samples. The color removal was up to 98%, with the removal efficiency
   being linear with the dose at a particular time. This method could
   exhibit the complete color removal of the dye wastewater, leading to
   mineralization coupled with a change in the oxidation state of Mn from
   +7 to +2. The method also improved the BOD/COD ratio, followed by an
   increase in the salinity of the recycled water. This indicated that this
   method can be used not only for the highly efficient de-colorization of
   dye wastewater but also as a preliminary step for the utilization of the
   dye wastewater after its recycling. The newly developed system was
   proven to be very cost-effective and eco-friendly with low sludge
   quantity, which contained numerous nitrogenous compounds, and this was
   validated by FTIR and HPLC analyses; thus, the system may be used in
   treatment plants for the recovery of wastewater.

   was added. As the organic loading rate (OLR) increased from 0.33 g to
   0.66 g COD L-1 d(-1), a decrease in the performance of the two reactors
   was observed by monitoring the quality of treated effluents. However,
   the ASP working with enzyme addition showed a strong resistance to shock
   loadings and restored after few days compared to the control system,
   which was strongly inhibited. In fact, the enzyme addition improved the

   the first time. Characterization techniques, such as SEM, TEM, XRD,
   FT-IR, Raman, TGA, AFM and XPS were used to investigate the adsorbent
   properties. The highest adsorption capacity for real industrial and
   synthetic melanoidin solutions at optimum conditions were 18.31 and
   18.02 g g(-1,) respectively. The adsorption data were revealed to fit
   well in pseudo-second-order kinetics and Langmuir isotherm models.
   Findings from this study suggested that the GONs could be highly
   effective for melanoidin removal from molasses wastewater.

AB t Wastewater from textile industry is considered one of the major
   environmental challenges due to the large volume of highly colored,
   polluted and toxic effluent. This study investigated the treatability of
   real textile wastewater by pilot-scale anoxic-aerobic Membrane
   Bioreactor (MBR) system without sludge wasting for an operation period
   of 100 days. The proposed system was investigated under different
   Internal Recycle (IR) ratios and the impact of IR ratio on Total Organic
   Carbon (TOC), Total Nitrogen (TN) and Color removals were examined.
   Under IR ratios between anoxic and aerobic tanks of 0.0, 0.5 and 2.0,
   the respective average removal efficiency of TN was 20.9%, 53.4% and
   71.7%, whereas average color removal of 81%, 85% and 88%, respectively
   was noted. The results indicated that increase of recycle ratio from 0.5
   to 2.0 enhanced TN removal to about 71% and color removal to above 85%.
   The IR between anoxic and aerobic tanks has a significant role in TN and
   color removal due to its effect on the development of bacterial
   communities. On the other hand, the results indicate over 93% TOC
   removal, which was independent of IR ratio.t

AB The Electro-Fenton (EF) process was used for decolorization of an
   anthraquinone dye, Reactive Blue 69 (RB69) and a real textile
   wastewater. Hydrogen peroxide was electro-generated by reduction of
   dissolved oxygen in acidic solution. Carbon paper (CP) and carbon paper
   modified with carbon nanotubes (CP-CNT) were used as the cathode and a
   Pt sheet was used as the anode electrode. Hydrogen peroxide was
   continuously generated by the two-electron reduction of dissolved oxygen
   at cathode electrode while Fe3+ was added to the solution. The results
   indicated that the decolorization efficiency using CP-CNT cathode was
   higher than that of CP electrode. The effect of operational parameters
   such as applied current density, initial pH and electrolyte type was
   studied in an attempt to reach the higher dye removal efficiency. The
   results of COD measurements indicated that EF with CP-CNT led to 73%
   degradation after 300 min of electrolysis time. Also, for real textile
   wastewater containing reactive dyes, the results of COD measurements
   indicated that EF process caused 75% reduction after 420 min
   electrolysis time.

   Adsorption of the anionic dye was enhanced by the grafting process.
   Grafted clay mineral adsorbents proved to be efficient to remove the
   contaminants from a real wastewater from textile industry within 30 min.
   Both adsorbents showed good reusability and the maximum adsorption
   capacity was maintained stable after a 2-cycle test. Thus, hybrid

AB Textile dye effluents are among the most problematic pollutants because
   of their toxicity on several organisms and ecosystems. Low cost and
   ecocompatible bioremediation processes offer a promising alternative to
   the conventional and aspecific physico-chemical procedures adopted so
   far. Here, microorganisms resident on three real textile dyeing effluent
   were isolated, characterized, and tested for their decolorizing
   performances. Although able to survive on these real textile-dyeing
   wastewaters, they always showed a very low decolorizing activity. On the
   contrary, several plant-associated fungi (Bjerkandera adusta, Funalia
   trogii, Irpex lacteus, Pleurotus ostreatus, Trametes hirsuta,
   Trichoderma viride, and Aspergillus nidulans) were also assayed and
   demonstrated to be able both to survive and to decolorize to various
   extents the three effluents, used as such in liquid cultures. The
   decolorizing potential of these fungi was demonstrated to be influenced
   by nutrient availability and pH. Best performances were constantly
   obtained using B. adusta and A. nidulans, relying on two strongly
   different mechanisms for their decolorizing activities: degradation for
   B. adusta and biosorption for A. nidulans. Acute toxicity tests using
   Daphnia magna showed a substantial reduction in toxicity of the three
   textile dyeing effluents when treated with B. adusta and A. nidulans, as
   suggested by mass spectrometric analysis as well.

AB The electrochemical oxidation of a real wastewater discharged by the
   baths of "Dar Dbagh" tannery (DDT) in Fez city (Morocco) was performed
   using Ti/Ti0.7Ru0.3O2 anode (a dimensionally stable anode (DSA)-type
   electrode) underflow condition. The effect of different operational
   parameters, namely chloride ions concentration, electrolysis time,
   current density, initial pH, and temperature has been studied in detail.
   The discoloration and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal have been
   taken as the key experimental indicators to monitor the electrochemical
   treatment process of DDT wastewater. The obtained results have shown
   that the best degradation rates (i.e., 100% and 56% of de-colorization
   and COD removal, respectively) were accomplished under acidic conditions
   at 20 mA cm(-2) as a current density in the presence of 0.033 M Na2SO4 +
   0.800 M NaCl as supporting electrolyte at room temperature. The maximum
   reduction of the effluent COD attained using Ti/Ti0.7Ru0.3O2 anode
   consuming 39.24 kWh per m(3) clearly shows that DSA electrodes could be
   a good alternative for the remediation of DDT effluents.

AB An electrochemical oxidation (EO) process with Ti/RuO2 anodes was
   applied to treat phenolic wastewaters. In order to optimise the system,
   different operating conditions were tested. The nature of the
   electrolyte and the applied current density greatly affected the
   process, while the concentration of the electrolyte as well as the
   initial pH had a sparingly impact. The optimum operating conditions
   attained, 10 gL(-1) of NaCl, 119 mA cm(-2) and initial pH 3.4, allowed
   the complete removal of the total phenolic content (TPh) and chemical
   oxygen demand (COD) when applied to a simulated phenolic mixture. SEM
   analysis revealed no morphological differences on the surface of the
   anode before and after it being used in EO. Neuronal studies were
   performed to verify the impact of the synthetic phenolic effluent,
   before and after the EO treatment, in the formation of neuronal reactive
   oxygen species (ROS). The treated effluent had a milder effect, compared
   to the raw one, but neuronal activity became enhanced after its removal.
   Regarding the depuration of an undiluted real olive mill wastewater
   (OMW) under the optimised parameters, the treatment achieved 100% of TPh
   removal and 17.2% of COD removal. Thus, the EO can be considered a
   satisfactory pre-treatment process to real wastewaters, since all
   phenolic content can be removed in 180 min. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Removal of a commercial dye (Procion yellow H-EXL) in both synthetic and
   real wastewater from textile industry over TiO2 suspension has been
   investigated. The study included both adsorption process (over TiO2) and
   photocatalytic degradation process in the presence of UV illumination
   (UV/TiO2). The processes were carried out in aqueous solutions
   containing the dye in the presence of titanium dioxide, TiO2, (Degussa
   P-25) upon UV irradiation of 100W. The photocatalytic process used the
   photogenerated holes (at the surface of TiO2) and hydroxyl radicals (at
   the solution bulk) as oxidizing species for the dye. Different
   parameters affecting the adsorption and photocatalytic degradation
   processes such as solution pH, initial dye concentration, and TiO2
   dosages were investigated, Results obtained revealed that various dye
   concentration loads were removed at optimum solution pH = 5 with TiO2
   dosage of 1 g/L. The dye removal % is inversely proportional to its
   concentration, the lower the dyes concentration, the higher the
   efficiency of dye removal. The efficiency values of both adsorption and
   photocatalytic degradation processes reached maximum values of 46.4 and
   100%, respectively, with dye concentration of 10 mg/L. The
   photocatalytic degradation of the investigated dye exhibited pseudo
   first-order kinetics according to the Langmuir-Hinshelwood's

   of 0.0 and 13.6 mg/L with the electrical currents of 0.0, 15.8, 22.1 and

   The increase of electrical current did not increase color removal.
   Significant color removal efficiencies were only observed in the stages
   that simultaneously applied both electrocoagulation and ozonation,
   indicating a synergistic effect. Thus, continuous systems that combine

   into the environment is source of pollution and this is a problem that
   particularly affect textile, dyeing and food industries. The review: (i)
   presents an analysis of various mechanisms involved in the different
   processes for color removal; (ii) describes conveniences and
   disadvantages that may exist in adopting one type of treatment in spite
   of another; (iii) reports the results of approximately 180 experimental
   tests. Both examples of treatments already widely applied to the real
   scale and still in the experimental phase are reported. This work
   focuses on different types of chemical/physical, chemical,
   electrochemical and biological processes applied in the field of color
   removal from industrial wastewater. Common chemical/physical treatments
   such as coagulation/flocculation, adsorption and membrane filtration as
   well as chemical-type processes are discussed, both those that exploit
   the traditional oxidizing chemical agents such as Ozone, H2O2 and
   reactive based on chlorine and those based on the principle of advanced
   chemical oxidation. In particular, both Hydroxyl radical based Advanced
   Oxidation Processes (AOPs) and Sulfate radical based AOPs are reported.
   The most commonly used Electrochemical processes for the removal of
   color are also presented as well as biological treatments. Based on more
   than 200 papers, this review provides important information on the use,
   effectiveness, advantages and downsides of the various treatments aimed
   at removing the color from the wastewater with a look at the
   technologies still under development.

AB Treatment of textile wastewater containing reactive dyes is highly
   important as dyes and their breakdown products are toxic. The
   application of chemical coagulation and Fenton oxidation on the color
   and the chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction of Reactive Black 5 (RB
   5) dye solution, the synthetic textile wastewater (STW), and the real
   dye bath real textile wastewater (RTW), was investigated. Among three
   coagulants used, polyaluminium chloride (PAC) decolorized more than 98%
   of RB 5 dye at a dosage of 200 ppm and pH = 5, while most common
   coagulants, alum, and FeSO4, removed only 11% and 6% of RB 5 dye,
   respectively. PAC removed also 80% of the COD at 300 ppm dosage. All the
   three coagulants failed to decolorize highly saline STW containing RB 5
   dye, but 80% decolorization was successfully achieved for the real
   textile dye bath wastewater by the polyaluminium coagulant dosage of 400
   ppm while alum and FeSO4 of the same dosage reduced only about 66% and
   75%, respectively. Fenton oxidation reduced 98% of the color and 61% of
   the COD in 100 ppm RB 5 dye at pH = 3 and dosage of 0.2 mM Fe2+ and 2.0
   mM H2O2. The COD was reduced by 90% when Fe2+ dose was increased to 0.5
   mM keeping the Fe-2:H2O2 ratio 1:10. When pH was increased from 3 to 7,
   the color reduction decreased from 91% to 78%. STW was decolorized to
   87% by 0.25 mM Fe2+ and 2.0 mM H2O2 at pH = 3. For the discoloration of
   RTW, the optimum Fenton condition was 0.1 mM Fe2+ and 0.5 mM H2O2 at the
   same acidic condition. The current study reveals that the coagulation
   with PAC and Fenton oxidation can be successfully used to treat the real
   textile dye bath wastewater containing reactive dyes.

AB Dyes are priority pollutants, commonly found at significant
   concentrations in textile effluents. The presence of dye stuffs in
   wastewater can cause severe problems to aquatic life and human beings.
   Therefore, the removal of dyes from wastewater is important in order to
   minimize their hazardous effects on the environment. The best microbial
   species for such an application was selected amongst the isolated
   bacterial populations by conducting cold bifunctional reactive dye
   namely CI Reactive Yellow 174 (CI RY 174) batch degradation studies
   using bacterial strains. The most suitable species wereSphingomonas
   paucimobilis,Pseudomonas putidaandLactobacillus acidophilus. Process
   parameters were optimized using response surface methodology (RSM) and
   under the optimum conditions (e.g. inoculum size of 10% (OD600nm= 1),
   temperature of 35 degrees C, 150 ppm, and time of 5 days). The maximum
   COD and color removal efficiencies, when tested with 750 ppm dye using
   batch reactors were found to be 86% and 90%, respectively. Our results
   showed that bacteria had a high decolorization capacity. High regression
   coefficient values (predictedR(2)= 83.65%) confirmed that the predicted
   values were in compliance with the experimental values implying the
   appropriateness of the employed regression model. The adequacy of the
   model was validated by different descriptive statistics viz, regression,
   residual error,Fandpvalues. UV-visible and FTIR spectroscopy analysis
   confirmed the biodegradation of CI RY 174. Using phytotoxicity
   endpoints, toxicological studies of CIRY 174 before and after
   biodegradation were studied. Toxicity assay proved that biodegradation
   led to detoxification of CIRY 174 dye.

AB Microbial fuel cell (MFC) has been used to treat various types of
   organic effluents using microbes as biocatalysts, producing electrical
   energy. The electrodes play a significant role in the MFC
   bioelectro-chemical processes. The present study reports the use of
   carbon rods from used batteries as cathode material for textile dye
   degradation and decolorization. The concept of using carbon rods from
   used zinc carbon cell is novel and a green process of waste recycling in
   a MFC. Real textile dye effluent was loaded in the MFC anode. The MFC
   under investigation had produced a maximum power of 56.42 mW and with
   90% reduction in COD over a time period of 600 h. The percent
   decolourization attained was 28.5%. The FESEM analysis of biofilm
   observed was opaque and thick sheets surrounded by a strong coat of
   possibly exopolysaccharide. Bio-film under optical microscopy, the
   microbes appeared to be isolated and bilobed. The results of this study
   indicate that the carbon rods from zinc carbon cell can be harvested as
   a MFC cathode for dye degradation and simultaneous power production.

AB This paper presents a novel end-to-end pilot scale photocatalytic
   treatment of real textile & dyeing industry effluent, which involved
   innovative approach in primary treatment, followed by Heterogenous
   Photocatalysis (HP) involving nano-TiO2/UV as secondary treatment and
   suitable filtration leading to treated water meeting process water
   quality enhancing water re-use efficiency. This enables Zero Liquid
   Discharge (ZLD); which is the need of the hour in tackling problems of
   point source pollution and Water Conservation in developing countries
   like India. Overall treatment led to complete degradation and
   mineralization of organic pollutants and dye stuff thereby achieving
   adequate treatment, complete decolourization and deodorization of the
   effluent and almost hundred times less quantities of sludge residues in
   comparison to those obtained in conventional treatment methods. The
   nature and elemental composition of sludge residues, as investigated
   using Energy Dispersive Xray (EDX) elemental analysis, confirms complex
   organic dye components mineralized and nature being nontoxic. The
   complete treatment took place in 5 h without any kind of bioremediation
   method, which further highlights highly efficient and fast treatment
   coupled with small footprint. Overall cost of treatment is estimated to
   be around 1.55 USD/m(3). Such an innovation in wastewater treatment is
   expected to bring a revolution in developing countries, which are
   grappled together with problems of rapid industrialization,
   urbanization, regulatory compliances and environmental challenges.

AB Residues of Mabea fistulifera Mart. were used in this study as a
   bioadsorbent for the removal of the Reactive Blue 21 (RB 21) and Direct
   Red 80 (DR 80) dyes from aqueous solutions and samples of real effluents
   enriched with these dyes. The influence of pH, kinetic, and adsorptive
   parameters for the removal these dyes were investigated by conducting a
   series of batch experiments. The maximum adsorption using this
   bioadsorbent was observed at pH = 2.0 for both dyes. The time of
   adsorption equilibrium was established at 300 minutes for DR 80 and 120
   minutes for RB 21. The Langmuir model stood out because it described the
   behavior of the sorptive system with higher fidelity than the Freundlich
   model showing the coefficient of determination (R²) above 0.98. It was
   possible to obtain the maximum adsorption capacity of the bioadsorbent,
   for the Direct Red 80 and Reactive Blue 21 dyes, using the Langmuir
   Isotherm; these values were determined as 4.92 mg g-1 and 11.13 mg g-1,
   respectively. The pseudo-second order kinetic model best described the
   adsorption process of the RB 21 dye by the bioadsorbent, however, the
   intra-particle diffusion is also involved in the mechanism of
   adsorption. The Morris and Weber diffusion model suggested that the
   intra-particle diffusion is prevalent throughout the process of
   adsorption for the DR 80 dye. The bioadsorbent was employed on real
   textile effluent samples enriched with aqueous solutions of these dyes
   after the adsorptive conditions were optimized; 85 % RB 21 and 94 % DR
   80 removal rates were obtained from the effluent's matrix.
Y4 Neste estudo empregou-se resíduos de Mabea fistulifera Mart. como
   bioadsorvente para a remoção dos corantes Reactive Blue 21 (RB 21) e
   Direct Red 80 (DR 80) em soluções aquosas e em amostras de efluentes
   reais fortificados com estes corantes. Foram investigados os ensaios da
   influência do pH, cinéticos e adsortivos para a remoção dos corantes por
   meio de uma série de experimentos de batelada. O bioadsorvente exibiu
   máxima adsorção em pH = 2,0 para ambos os corantes. O tempo de
   equilíbrio da adsorção foi estabelecido em 300 minutos para o DR 80 e
   120 minutos para o RB 21. O modelo de Langmuir descreveu com maior
   fidelidade o comportamento do sistema sortivo, apresentando coeficiente
   de determinação (R²) superior a 0,98. Por meio da Isoterma de Langmuir,
   foi possível obter a capacidade máxima de adsorção dos corantes Direct
   Red 80 e Reactive Blue 21 pelo bioadsorvente sendo encontrados os
   valores de 4,92 mg g-1 e 11,13 mg g-1, respectivamente. O modelo
   cinético de pseudo-segunda ordem melhor descreveu o processo de adsorção
   do corante RB 21 sob o bioadsorvente, embora a difusão intra-partícula
   também esteja envolvida no mecanismo de adsorção. Já para o corante DR
   80 o modelo de difusão de Morris e Weber sugeriu que a difusão
   intra-partícula é predominante em todo o processo de adsorção. Depois de
   otimizadas as condições adsortivas, o bioadsorvente foi empregado a
   amostras de efluentes têxteis reais fortificadas com soluções aquosas
   dos corantes, obtendo-se 85 % de remoção do RB 21 e 94 % de remoção do
   DR 80 na matriz do efluente.

AB Large scale applications of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) have been
   severely hindered by several problems such as high internal resistance,
   low power output, expensive materials, and complicated configuration. To
   address these issues, a granular activated carbon based single chamber
   microbial fuel cell (GACB-SCMFC) has been designed using GAC-biocathodes
   without using any expensive materials for the simultaneous
   decolorization of real dye wastewater and electricity generation. The
   GACB-SCMFC produced a power density of 8W/m(3) which indicates the
   GAC-biocathode can be a good alternative to platinum and other chemical
   catalysts. The dye wastewater was primarily treated at the anode and
   further polishing steps were occurred at the aerobic cathode. Toxicity
   measurement shows that the effluent after GACB-SCMFC operation was much
   less toxic compared to the original dye wastewater. Additional advantage
   of the GACB-SCMFC is that pH was automatically adjusted from 12.2 to 8
   during 48 h of hydraulic retention time (HRT). (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this study, the oxidation of textile effluent containing Bismarck dye
   (BD) has been carried out via a cost-efficient and eco-friendly
   heterogeneous photo-Fenton method under natural solar radiations as well
   as artificial UV source. Hematite nanocrystals that were successfully
   prepared using a simple sol-gel approach were tested for use as a
   catalyst in the Fenton process. X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscope techniques
   were applied to investigate the structural and morphological properties
   of these nanocrystals. The results showed that the material had a better
   photocatalytic activity under sunlight irradiation. The process of solar
   photo-Fenton reagent including nanocrystals was found to be competent
   for the oxidation of BD compared with the process of using artificial UV
   irradiations. The oxidation was improved to a great extent from 23 to
   60% removal in the treatment time of 60-min irradiation. The dye load
   increase in wastewater results in a low oxidation rate. The key factor
   is containing 40 and 400 mg L-1 of hematite nanocrystals and H2O2,
   respectively, at pH 3.0. Further, the temperature increases increment
   the reaction rate. The oxidation process follows pseudo-second-order
   kinetics with activation energy of 1.3 kJ mol(-1). Thus, the practical
   application of such nanocrystals on the Fenton system using natural UV
   radiation on the real textile effluent signifies that process is highly
   efficient for a safer environment.

AB Electrocoagulation (EC) is a promising method that has been effectively
   employed in the treatment of various types of industrial effluent. Its
   distinct advantages such as good effluent quality, compact installation,
   simple operation and reduced sludge generation make it effective to
   treat numerous recalcitrant pollutants. To provide an overview of the
   current state and future potential of EC technology in industrial
   wastewater treatment, this paper presents a review of the most relevant
   recent publications. Aspects such as the characteristics, mechanism, and
   applicability of EC and factors affecting the EC efficiency are
   thoroughly reviewed. Additionally, the management of EC sludge as well
   as the development of emerging hybrid technologies are discussed
   systematically. This review highlights the applicability of EC in the
   treatment of real industrial wastewaters. In the long term, the EC
   treatment process will likely be recognized as one of the core methods
   for the treatment of various industrial effluents.

   and Portunus sanguinolentus was evaluated and optimized for the removal
   of color and turbidity from simulated paint industry effluent (SPE). A
   series of bench-scale flocculation experiments were conducted in jar
   test apparatus to examine the optimal dose of coagulant, at different
   initial pH and initial concentration of the effluent. The eluent type
   and concentration were varied, to extract the maximum amount of active
   coagulant compounds viz, proteins (from S. potatorum, M. oleifera),
   cellulose (from C. opuntia), chitosan (from P. sanguinolentus),
   polysaccharides (from C. tetragonolobus) and to attain the maximum
   removal efficiency. The obtained optimized conditions from the SPE were
   applied for the treatment of real paint industry effluent. All the five
   coagulants exhibited the maximum removal efficiency at the actual pH of
   the effluent itself. The coagulation kinetic study suggests the order of
   kinetics, and the model parameters were obtained from the linear
   equations. The time evolution pattern of formation of monomers, dimmers
   and trimmers was evaluated. The comparisons of the green coagulants with
   chemical coagulants have also been studied.

AB The biological colour removal from textile wastewater is challenging
   because of the toxicity of dyes to microorganisms, and the need to test
   the process on real streams in order to ensure the reliability of the
   produced data. This present study has provided a comparative analysis of
   the bio-decolorization of a real wastewater containing a mixture of azo
   dyes under different environments: single aerobic and anaerobic, and
   sequential anaerobic-aerobic. Tests were performed in sequencing batch
   reactors operated at different exchange ratios and colour loads in the
   range of 0.1-0.3 and 0.002-0.1 kg(COD) m(-3) d(-1), respectively. The
   work cycle lasted 24 h. With reference to the dominant wavelength,
   lambda = 536 nm, resulting from the influent characterization, a maximum
   limit value of -30% was observed for the colour removal in the aerobic
   system. Better performance has been achieved with the anaerobic (65%
   removal) and the sequential anaerobic-aerobic system, which reached
   efficiencies of 70-80%, for the range of applied colour loads. The
   sequential system exhibits the highest removal rate, which, for the
   highest colour load, is equal, in terms of absorbance units to 0.043 AU
   d(-1) L-1. These values are even higher than the process rates obtained
   with more complex technologies, such as the granular sludge bioreactors.
   The demonstrated high performance of the sequential process with a real
   wastewater is a relevant step forward for promoting the application of
   the biological treatment (more sustainable than the generally employed
   chemical physical ones) to remediate highly polluted dye streams. (C)

AB Iron nanoparticles can be incorporated on the structure of natural clays
   to obtain magnetic clays, an adsorbent that be easily removed from a
   wastewater by magnetic means. Magnetic clays have high adsorption
   capacities of different contaminants such as heavy metals, fungicides,
   aromatic compounds and colorants and show rapid adsorption kinetics, but
   crucial data for achieving its full or pilot scale application is still
   lacking. In this work, magnetic bentonites with different amounts of
   magnetite (iron fractions on the clay of 0.55, 0.6 and 0.6) were used to
   remove color from a real textile wastewater. On a first stage the
   optimal conditions for the adsorption of the dye, including pH,
   temperature and clay dosage were determined. Also design parameters for
   the separation process such as residence time, distance from magnet to
   magnetic clay and magnet strength were obtained. Finally a pilot scale
   magnetic drum separator was constructed and tested. A removal of 60% of
   the dye from a wastewater that contained more than 250 ppm of azo dye
   was achieved with only 10 min of residence time inside the separator.

AB In this study, experiments were conducted for the treatment of textile
   wastewater containing- a diazo dye i.e. Congo Red dye (CR) and a basic
   dye Methylene Blue (MB). Performances of Electrocoagulation-Flotation
   (EC-F) and Pulsed Power Plasma Treatment (PPT) technologies were
   evaluated individually and in combination. The effects of various
   parameters such as electrolysis time, electrical conductivity (EC,
   mS/cm), current density (mA/cm(2)) and initial concentrations of dye
   were experimentally optimized to get high removal efficiency. Using EC-F
   alone, the dye concentration was reduced from 50 mg/L to BDL (below
   detection level) and 50 mg/L to 3.1 mg/L for CR and MB dyes,
   respectively at a current density of 14.2 mA/cm(2), electrical
   conductivity 8 mS/cm. To achieve this, an electrolysis time of 2 and 14
   min were employed for CR and MB, respectively. To mitigate the problems
   of passivation of electrodes and sludge formation, EC-F was integrated
   with PPT treatment system. Also, the removal efficiencies of both the
   systems were evaluated by treating mixed dyes and real textile
   wastewater. It was found that by giving a partial treatment in EC-F
   followed by PPT was able to achieve 100% (TOC) degradation of MB with a
   total energy consumption of 50.55 kW h/kg dye removed and 39.3 kW h/kg
   dye for CR. The complete (100%) mineralization of the pollutant was
   achieved without any chemical addition and no waste (sludge) was
   produced at the end of novel hybrid treatment. The total treatment cost
   was reduced by 41.2% (86.04 kW h/kg dye to 50.55 kW h/kg dye) for MB and
   30.7% (56.7 kW h/kg dye to 39.3 kW h/kg dye) for CR in hybrid system as

   (POH ) groups able to exchange inorganic and organic cations or to
   intercalate basic molecules. The present review deals with the use of
   this material as a sorbent for heavy metal cations or dye molecules in
   wastewater treatments. The possibility to combine ZrP with polymers or
   other inorganic materials, in order to have suitable systems for real
   and large scale applications, was investigated, as well as the
   combination with photocatalytic materials to obtain hetrogeneous
   photocatalysts for the capture and photodegradation of organic dye
   molecules.

AB The present study investigates the use of defatted microalgal
   biomass-DAB (waste from microalgal biofuel) as an alternative proposal
   adsorbent of leather dyes. The biomass was characterized by analytical
   techniques of Zeta Potential, FTIR, SEM, BET and BJH. The sorption
   experiments were performed using aqueous dye solutions of Acid Blue 161
   (AB-161) and the equilibrium studies were carried out by variation in
   different parameters, i.e., pH (2-11), biosorbent dosage (0.005-0.040
   g), contact time (0-540 min), temperature (25-40 degrees C) and dye
   concentration (200-1500 mg L-1). In the evaluation of the kinetic
   mechanism that controls the adsorption process examined at 200 and 400
   mg L-1, it was observed that data fitted quite well with general order
   kinetic model. Freundlich isotherm model showed the best fit of the
   equilibrium data at boths experimental temperatures. The maximum amounts
   of AB-161 dye adsorbed were 75.78 mg g(-1) at 25 degrees C and 83.2 mg
   g(-1) at 40 degrees C. For treatment of real tannery wastewater, the
   results show that DMB significantly reduced the dye concentration
   (76.65%), TOC (50.78%) and TN (19.80%). From the thermodynamic
   parameters for the adsorption of AB-161 with DMB indicated a spontaneous
   endothermic process with a physical reaction by electrostatic
   interaction. Therefore, defatted microalgal biomass showed to be a
   promising material for adsorption of dye from tannery effluent.

AB An efficient biosorbent, sugarcane bagasse was used in native,
   HCl-treated, and Na-alginate immobilized form for the removal of Direct
   Violet 51 dye from aqueous solutions. Batch study was performed to
   optimize important process parameters, such as pH, contact time,
   biosorbent dose, initial dye concentration, and temperature. Removal of
   Direct Violet 51 was found to be favorable at pH 2 with the biosorbent
   dose of 0.05 g. Biosorption process was found to be exothermic in
   nature. Maximum dye biosorption (39.6 mg/g) was achieved by using
   HCl-treated biomass. The pseudo-second-order kinetic and Langmuir
   adsorption isotherm models showed best fitness to the experimental data.
   Thermodynamic study was also performed to determine the feasibility of
   biosorption process. Continuous mode study was performed to optimize the
   important process parameters, such as bed height, flow rate, and initial
   dye concentration for maximum removal of Direct Violet 51 dye. The
   higher bed height, low flow rate, and high initial dye concentration
   were found to be the better conditions for maximum dye biosorption
   (17.28 mg/g). The linearized form of the Thomas model equation fitted
   well to the experimental data. The bed depth service time model was used
   to express the effect of bed height on breakthrough curves.
   Characterization of biosorbent was performed by scanning electron
   microscopy and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis. The FT-IR
   spectral analyses showed the involvement of hydroxyl, carbonyl, and
   carboxyl groups in biosorption process. These results indicated that
   sugarcane bagasse biomass could be used as a novel biosorbent for the
   removal of Direct Violet 51 dye from real textile and related
   industries.

AB China is a major textile manufacturer in the world; as a result, large
   quantities of dyeing effluents are generated every year in the country.
   In this study, the performances of two cationic starch-based flocculants
   with different chain architectures, i.e.,
   starch-graft-poly[(2-methacryloyloxyethyl) trimethyl ammonium chloride]
   (STC-g-PDMC) and starch-3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl trimethyl ammonium
   chloride (STC-CTA), in flocculating dissolved organic matter (DOM) in
   dyeing secondary effluents were investigated and compared with that of
   polyaluminum chloride (PAC). In the exploration of the flocculation
   mechanisms, humic acid (HA) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were selected
   as main representatives of DOM in textile dyeing secondary effluents,
   which were humic/fulvic acid-like and protein like extracellular matters
   according to the studied wastewater's characteristics based on its
   three-dimensional excitation emission matrix spectrum. According to
   experimental results of the flocculation of both the real and synthetic
   wastewaters, STC-g-PDMC with cationic branches had remarkable advantages
   over STC-CTA and PAC because of the more efficient charge neutralization
   and bridging flocculation effects of STC-g-PDMC. Another interesting
   finding in this study was the reaggregation phenomenon after
   restabilization at an overdose during the flocculation of BSA effluents
   by STC-g-PDMC at a very narrow pH range under a nearly neutral
   condition. This phenomenon might be ascribed to the formation of
   STC-g-PDMC/BSA complexes induced by some local charge interactions
   between starch based flocculant and the amino acid fragments of protein
   due to charge patch effects. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Dyes and pigments are beginning to do in the country considered as a

   the aesthetic aspects in wastewater. This review attempted to cluster
   the most effective treatments for the removal, destruction and
   mineralization of dyes and pigments present in wastewater depend on the
   physicochemical properties of the constituent molecules. The kinetics of
   removal of BOD, COD, "real" colour and "apparent" in effluents, in
   addition to operating times were studied to determine the set of
   physical technologies, chemical, biological and combined major and
   influence nowadays. Among the most relevant treatment technologies
   highlights the adsorption and filtration, advanced oxidation
   technologies (photocatalysis, ozonation, fenton / UV,
   electrocoagulation, etc.) and sequential biological processes (type
   anaerobic - aerobic). The influence of variables such as the pH, the
   initial concentration of dye and solubility, among others, on the
   kinetics of removal of specific dyes are evident.

AB This study investigated the performance of DCMD applied to wastewaters
   from different stages of the textile process in the same operating
   system for water reclamation in a single process. High final color
   rejection (>98.7%) was obtained and water was recovered at the permeate
   side for polyester dyeing wastewater and textile effluent from the
   equalization tank (final permeate flux up to 15.8 kg center dot
   m(-2)center dot h(-1)). The color rejection was maintained possibly due
   to membrane internal hydrophobicity, which prevented total wetting. The
   possibility of wastewater treatment by the DCMD process was essentially
   dependent on textile wastewater composition. During cotton and viscose
   dyeing wastewater treatment, severe wetting of the membrane was due to
   the presence of cationic and nonionic surfactants in high concentration,
   requiring further studies. Different types of membrane fouling with
   textile wastewaters were observed, which may result in different
   cleaning procedures. Higher color rejection with textile wastewater,
   when compared to dye solutions, was due to deposition/adsorption of some
   elements on the membrane surface, which established a composite layer
   with higher wetting resistance. DCMD showed to be a promising technology
   for treating real textile wastewater due to its good performance in
   color rejection and water recovery.

AB Many of the basic dyes are non- degradable and toxic pollutants in
   textile industrial wastewater. Methylene blue (MB) is a cationic dye
   that exists at a large scale in the textile wastewater which is
   discharged into the nearby environment without proper management,
   particularly in developing countries including Ethiopia. Therefore, this
   study aimed to evaluate the adsorption performance of MB from textile
   wastewater using locally prepared activated carbon produced from
   Parthenium hysterophorus stem. The plant samples were activated using
   H3PO4. The activated carbon was then characterized using proximate
   analysis, scanning electron microscope and Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy. Batch adsorption studies were conducted to determine the
   optimum condition for removal of MB from synthetic and real textile
   industrial wastewater under the effect of pH, contact time, adsorbent
   dose, and initial MB concentration. The adsorption isotherms were
   checked using Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms models. The result of
   the proximate analysis has shown that the activated carbon was composed
   of 5.7% moisture, 15.3% ash, 18.6% volatile matter and 60.4% fixed
   carbon. Using an aqueous solution, the maximum MB removal of 94% was
   achieved at the pH value 11, contact time 100 min, adsorbent dose 2 g in
   100 mL and at the initial MB concentration 100 mg/L, whereas the maximum
   removal of MB from actual textile wastewater was found to be 91%. The
   Langmuir isotherm model was best fitted with experimental values
   atR(2)was 0.99. Finally, it can be concluded that the activated carbon
   has a good adsorption capability and promising for MB removal from
   textile wastewater at an industrial scale.

   photocatalyst was exhibited an excellent photocatalytic degradation
   effect towards Eriochrome black T (EBT) dye due to its low optical
   energy band gap (E-g = 2.74 eV) in aqueous solution at different pH
   values (2.0-12.0), irradiation time (sec), concentrations of catalyst,
   and dye. The greater depth of EBT dye degradation (98.17%), pseudo first
   order rate constant (k, 0.914 s(-1)) value with correlation coefficient
   value (R-2, 0.99) were achieved at pH 12.0 using 5 x 10(-3) M of
   photocatalyst and 5 x 10(-2) M of EBT dye for 700 sec irradiation. The
   obtained spectral, kinetic results were ascribed that the degradation of
   EBT dye was pH dependent and the radicals involved in the photocatalytic
   EBT dye degradation pathway (Type-1 p-n heterojunction photocatalyst).
   The present CuO@g-C3N4 nanocomposite photocatalyst was showed an
   excellent stability and reusability even after using 15 consecutive

AB A multistage fluidized bed bioreactor (M-FBBR) was developed for Congo
   Red (CR) dye removal using Polyurethane foam (PUF)-immobilized Bacillus
   subtilis. The active surface area for microbial growth and biological
   interaction are important factors to be considered for immobilization
   mediated decolorization. In the present study, the active surface area
   can be improved in the reactor in two ways, (i) by avoiding the
   accumulation of PUF on the top surface of reaction volume and (ii) by
   providing free moving foams in larger number. To achieve this, existing
   FBBR was modified by introducing a porous stainless steel box (PSSB),
   which is autoclavable, custom made, and cost-effective. To elucidate
   this, dye decolorization studies were conducted in both FBBR and M-FBBR.
   The enhanced CR dye removal was observed in M-FBBR. Further,
   optimization study for MFBBR approach showing the maximum CR dye removal
   (92%), was obtained at a dye concentration of 100 mg/L, PUF weight- 5 g,
   pH-8, and glucose concentration- 4 g/L respectively. Extensive
   mineralization has been performed for synthetic and real textile
   wastewater (RTW), and the significant COD reduction (86.6%, 90.15%) and
   TOC reduction (57.54%, 69.13%) were observed for synthetic wastewater
   and RTW respectively.

AB Biodecolourization of azo dye and removal of ammonium by aerobic
   granular sludge (AGS) was investigated under different growth
   conditions. AGS not previously exposed to azo dye was able to
   effectively decolourize azo dye under anaerobic and microaerophilic
   conditions. Azo dye, total organic carbon and ammoniacal nitrogen
   removal efficiencies of 89-100%, 79-95% and 92-100%, respectively, were
   achieved in the AGS reactor operated for 80 days under microaerophilic
   conditions. Removal of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus was not impacted
   by azo dye loading. Azo dye, organic carbon and ammonium were majorly
   removed in the anoxic period wherein bulk dissolved oxygen was ranged
   from 0.5 and <0.08 mg L-1. Removal of 60 mg L-1 NH4+-N was associated
   only with smaller amounts of nitrite build-up (similar to 5 mg L-1
   NO2--N) and negligible nitrate concentrations. Profiles of nitrogen
   compounds in individual sequencing batch reactor cycles supported the
   occurrence of ammonium removal over nitrite pathway. Bacterial community
   analysis showed enrichment of specific microorganisms capable of
   decolourizing azo dyes in the dye-decolourizing AGS. Dye decolourization
   and nutrient removal by AGS under microaerophilic conditions is a novel
   finding and can be further developed for treating textile wastewaters
   onsite or after dilution with sewage. (C). 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB The rapid growth of population and industrialization results in
   pollution of freshwater sources which leads to the water stress
   conditions on the world in future. Adsorption is a low cost and popular
   technique for the removal of contaminants from water bodies. Most of the
   reports till date are on removal of a single component from aqueous
   solutions using this technique, but the real-world effluent contains
   multiple contaminants such as dyes, heavy metals, pesticides,
   antibiotics and many more. Therefore, a study on simultaneous removal of
   contaminants is highly needed to obtain a suitable adsorbent that can be
   used commercially. This critical review provides a de-tailed study on
   the removal of contaminants in the presence of other contaminant/s i.e.,
   from a multi -component system (MCS). The different possible interaction
   mechanisms in MCS like synergism, antagonism and non-interaction are
   discussed. The MCS containing the mixture of conventional contaminants
   such as heavy metals and dyes, and other emerging contaminants such as
   antibiotics, organic contaminants, pesticides and personal care products

AB In the current study, the potential use of palygorskite (is also
   mentioned as "attapulgite") clay as a sorbent for copper metal ions and
   dyes (Methylene blue) from aqueous solutions, which can be both
   industrial and urban, was examined. The clay sample was evaluated (a) as
   received without any further modification, (b) after water washing and
   (c) after acidic treatment (HNO3). The adsorbents were characterized by
   cation exchange capacity, X-ray diffraction and nitrogen porosimetry.
   Dynamic measurements were performed in order to investigate the effect
   of different temperatures, pH values and clay's particle sizes on Cu2+
   adsorption. Breakthrough curves for Cu2+ and dye were performed in order
   to resemble real industrial applications. It was observed that the
   solution's pH was the dominant factor whereas treatment of palygorskite
   did not change significant the adsorption results in comparison to raw
   palygorskite.

AB Industrial use of heavy metals and dyes critically depends on the
   effective handling of industrial effluents. Effective remediation of
   industrial effluents using various adsorbent materials has thus become
   critical. In this paper, we study two-dimensional MXenes as an adsorbent
   for removing Cr(VI) and methyl orange (MO) in waters. The
   physico-chemical performance of MXenes was studied using X-ray
   diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,
   Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, scanning electron microscopy, high
   resolution-transmission electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis,
   and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques. The adsorption system,
   including influence of contact time, pH of solutions, co-ions, and
   desorption experiments were performed for effective Cr(VI) and MO
   removal. The Cr(VI) and MO removal rate of the MXenes was very fast, and
   the kinetic system was driven by pseudo-second-order kinetics. The
   sorption isotherm closely well-tailored with the Langmuir isotherm, and
   the maximum removal efficiencies were 104 and 94.8 mg/g for Cr (VI) and
   MO, respectively. The MXenes was successfully regenerated by 0.1 M NaOH
   aqueous solution and can be repeatedly recycled. The uptake of Cr(VI)
   and MO by the MXenes was mainly due to chemical adsorption, namely
   electrostatic adsorption, complexation, surface interactions, and ion
   exchange mechanisms. This investigation demonstrates the selectivity and
   feasibility of the MXenes as a real adsorbent for eliminating Cr(VI) and
   MO from the aqueous environment.

AB This study focused on the development of a nano-adsorbent for
   contaminant removal without the use of any external energy. An
   eco-friendly Fe3O4@MgO core-shell nanocomposite was synthesized and
   tested for the removal of a heavy metal, lead (Pb2+) and a dye,
   rhodamine B (RhB). The addition of H2O2 into the system enabled the
   self-mixing of the aqueous solution containing Fe3O4@MgO through the
   generation of bubbles. This system showed an excellent removal
   efficiency of 99% in just 15 min for Pb2+ and 120 min for RhB, which is
   far better than the control experiment (without H2O2). The cation
   exchange mechanism dominated in the removal of heavy metals, while the
   adsorptive removal of dye proceeded through the H-bonding between
   Mg(OH)(2) and dye molecules. The removal efficiency increased
   exponentially with the increase of H2O2 at the optimal concentration of
   5% and it was effective over a wide pH range. Moreover, the performance
   of the Fe3O4@MgO-H2O2 system was verified for other heavy metals such as
   Cd, Ni, Zn, Co, and Cu, demonstrating that the Fe3O4@M-gO-H2O2 system
   can be widely implemented in the treatment of real water matrices
   contaminated with heavy metals and organic dyes.

AB In this work, the photocatalytic activity of a new visible
   light-responsive (CIH3NH3)(3)Bi2I9 hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite
   (HOIP) was addressed for the very first time in the treatment of aqueous
   solutions of model organic dyes. The photocatalyst was successfully
   prepared by a low temperature solvo-termal method, easily reproducible.
   The catalyst was characterized by Fourier-transform infrared
   spectroscopy (FP-IR), X-ray diffraction spectrometer (XRD), scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDS), X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques and UV diffuse reflectance
   spectrum. The efficiency of photocatalyst was tested for the removal of
   different type of dyes: fluorone dye (rhodamine B), thiazine dye
   (methylene blue) and azo dye (reactive Blue 4). Moreover, a
   multi-contaminated solution, with methylene blue and crystal violet
   (triarylmethane dye), was used to simulate a real industrial wastewater
   effluent. The results highlighted an increase of the photocatalytic
   activity respect the pristine precursor, bismuth iodide. The experiments
   showed that the values of removal was higher for rhodamine B respect the
   other dyes, with a removal of 98% after three hours under visible light
   irradiation. The efficiency of the photocatalyst was also confirmed
   under optimal conditions with high pressure liquid chromatography
   (HPLC). The gradual disappearance of rhodamine B peak accompanied by the
   appearance of by-products peaks was investigated. The stability of the
   photocatalyst was tested for three consecutive re-cycles. Analysis on
   different visible light sources was performed: halogen provided higher
   efficiency respect LED lamp. The outcomes of the present work aim to
   open the possibility of considering HOIP as a new potential
   photocatalyst for contaminants treatment.

AB The use of low-cost and eco-friendly adsorbents has been investigated as
   an ideal alternative to the current expensive methods of removing dyes
   from wastewater. In this study, not hydrolyzed
   poly(styrene-alternative-maleic anhydride) (PSMA) polymer have been used
   as new synthetic adsorbent to removal of acid red-14 dye from aqueous
   solutions (industrial wastes). Batch sorption studies have been carried
   out to determine the effect of agitation time, pH, adsorbent dose, and
   initial concentration of the sorbate and temperature. The effect of
   electrolyte interference such as Na+ and Cl- on dyes removal efficiency
   was investigated. The acid red 14 dye showed maximal amount of sorption
   capacity as 5.12 mg/g at pH 6.1 and 25 degrees C. Equilibrium data were
   fitted with Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms to find the best fit, and
   it was found that the adsorption of this dye on adsorbents particles are
   monolayer and correspond to the Langmuir isotherm. Adsorption kinetics
   were investigated using pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order rate
   equations and kinetic data followed the pseudo-second-order rate
   equation for sorption of this dye on PSMA adsorbent. The application of
   adsorbents performance was tested with real samples which contain limit
   exceeded amount of foresaid dyes which had been taken from a Dyeing
   Factory. This study provides good background to development of dye
   removal in waste waters by polymeric sorbent.

AB An integrated system that consisted of a bioelectrochemical reactor
   (BER) and an aerobic completely stirred tank reactor (ACSTR) was
   constructed to treat simulated wastewater mixed with azo dye Acid Orange
   7 (AO7) and real municipal wastewater. It was found that AO7 could be
   efficiently decolorized in BER within 6 h while initial concentration
   fluctuated from 25 to 100 mg/L. With an initial AO7 concentration of 75
   mg/L, BER reached a decolorization efficiency of 93.65 +/- 2.45% at 6 h
   and contributed 26.56 +/- 8.91% of chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal.
   Coulombic efficiency (CE) of current generation varied from 23.19 +/-
   6.96 to 37.23 +/- 3.48% and CE for AO7 decolorization decreased from
   30.45 +/- 3.19 to 14.59 +/- 1.21% at the initial AO7 concentration of 50
   mg/L, which illustrated the important contribution of electrochemical
   reduction on AO7 decolorization. The effluent of BERs can be
   subsequently refined by ACSTR, the residual COD was 72 +/- 10 mg/L after
   6 h treatment with an activated sludge concentration of 6000 mg/L.
   Further increasing the sludge concentration to 9000 mg/L, final COD
   concentration decreased to 62 +/- 7 mg/L. Results showed that the
   bioelectrochemical-aerobic integrated system effectively treated the
   mixed azo dye containing wastewater.

   constant current (40 mA cm(-2)) in a combined electro/photochemical
   flow-cell using a Ti/Ru0.3Ti0.7O2 DSA(R) type electrode. The results
   show that the method is capable of removing color and chemical oxygen

   and type of supporting electrolyte (Na2SO4 or NaCl) was investigated.
   The principal figures of merit used in this study were COD removal and
   color removal (605 nm). The results show that up to 72% color and up to
   59% COD removal in 120 min is possible under the operating conditions
   employed. Studies of the phytotoxicity of the wastewater before and
   after the photo-assisted degradation assays are also presented and the
   results demonstrate that the toxicity of the effluent is dependent on
   the length of electrolysis time and the treatment procedure employed.

AB Cationic dyes are widely used colorants in textile and other related
   industries. These dyes are highly toxic for marine life and make a major
   fraction of the industrial effluents. In this study, we report the
   synthesis of ester derivative of calix[4]arene (EDC) impregnated polymer
   inclusion membrane (PIM) and employed it for the transfer of cationic
   dyes between two aqueous phases. EDC forms inclusion complex with
   cationic dyes having 1:1 M ratio as revealed by the Job's plot, the
   log/log plot, and the Benesi-Hildebrand methods while using methylene
   blue (MB) as a model cationic dye. EDC was used as carrier with
   cellulose triacetate (CTA) as a base polymer, and 2-nitrophenyl octyl
   ether (2-NPOE) as a plasticizer for the synthesis of EDC-PIM. Membranes
   were characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR),
   Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM),
   Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) analysis.
   The extraction performance of the synthesized PIM was optimized by
   varying different external parameters including pH of the donor and the
   acceptor phases, temperature, stirring speed, and concentration of EDC
   and dye while using MB as a model cationic dye. More than 90% extraction
   was achieved under optimized conditions which is 4.5-fold more than
   EDC-free-PIM. The extraction efficiency of the EDC-PIM remained similar
   after ten consecutive cycles that demonstrates its reusability potential
   in context of economical industrial applications. Finally, the
   synthesized EDC-PIM was used for selective extraction of other cationic
   dyes (basic red and nile blue) at the optimized conditions from the real
   industrial effluents. The extraction efficiency of the EDC-PIM was
   reproducible in all cases. The reusability and robustness of the EDC-PIM
   makes it an excellent candidate for retrieving cationic dyes from the
   industrial effluents.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of a membrane
   hybrid process for the treatment of real textile wastewater (TWW) and
   its potential reuse in the dyeing of cotton knitted fabric (DCF)
   process. To determine a suitable pretreatment, sand filtration,
   coagulation, and UF hollow fiber (UF-HF) were compared on a laboratory
   scale in terms of turbidity, color, and total organic carbon (TOC).
   Here, UF-HF provided the best removal results of 93.6%, 99.0%, and
   29.0%, respectively. The second stage involves the study of UF flat
   sheet membranes (5, 10, 20, and 50 kDa). The 5 kDa membrane provided the
   best permeate quality according to the chemical oxygen demand (COD),
   turbidity, TOC, conductivity, and color by 54.5%, 83.9%, 94.2%, and
   45.7-83.3%, respectively. The final step was treatment with
   nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) and these effluents were
   reused for dyeing. Finally, the effluents from UF-HF/5 kDa UF/RO
   (Scenario 1) and UF-HF/ 5 kDa UF/NF (Scenario 2) were analyzed for
   turbidity, COD, TOC, biological oxygen demand, conductivity, hardness,
   anions and cations, and color. Both scenarios provided high removal
   results of 76.3-83.5%, 94.6-97.7%, 88.5-99%, 95.4-98.0%, 59.2-99.0%,
   88.7-98.7%, 60.7-99.1%, and 80.0-100%, respectively. They also satisfied
   the DCF tests compared to the standard DCF samples. The innovative
   aspect of this research is as follows: 1) the complete analysis of
   hybrid membrane separation processes for the purpose of reuse of treated

AB Bioremediation of textile dyestuffs under solid-state fermentation (SSF)
   using industrial wastes as substrate pose an economically feasible,
   promising, and eco-friendly alternative. The purpose of this study was
   to adsorb Red M5B dye, a sample of dyes mixture and a real textile
   effluent on distillery industry waste-yeast biomass (DIW-YB) and its
   further bioremediation using Bacillus cereus EBT1 under SSF. Textile
   dyestuffs were allowed to adsorb on DIW-YB. DIW-YB adsorbed dyestuffs
   were decolorized under SSF by using B. cereus. Enzyme analysis was
   carried out to ensure decolorization of Red M5B. Metabolites after dye
   degradation were analyzed using UV-Vis spectroscopy, FTIR, HPLC, and
   GC-MS. DIW-YB showed adsorption of Red M5B, dyes mixture and a textile
   wastewater sample up to 87, 70, and 81 %, respectively. DIW-YB adsorbed
   Red M5B was decolorized up to 98 % by B. cereus in 36 h. Whereas B.
   cereus could effectively reduce American Dye Manufacture Institute value
   from DIW-YB adsorbed mixture of textile dyes and textile wastewater up
   to 70 and 100 %, respectively. Induction of extracellular enzymes such
   as laccase and azoreductase suggests their involvement in dye
   degradation. Repeated utilization of DIW-YB showed consistent adsorption
   and ADMI removal from textile wastewater up to seven cycles. HPLC and
   FTIR analysis confirms the biodegradation of Red M5B. GC-MS analysis
   revealed the formation of new metabolites. B. cereus has potential to
   bioremediate adsorbed textile dyestuffs on DIW-YB. B. cereus along with
   DIW-YB showed enhanced decolorization performance in tray bioreactor
   which suggests its potential for large-scale treatment procedures.

AB In this work, regeneration of Remazol dye loaded biochar produced from
   three different green marine seaweeds namely U.lactuca, U.reticulata and
   C.scalpelliformis was studied using different elutants as a regenerant.
   Before the regeneration, remediation of remazol dyes were studied in
   batch trails and U. Lactuca derived biochar is found to best -suited
   biochar for the remediation all four remazol dyes with a removal
   efficiency in the order of Remazol brilliant orange 3R (91%), followed
   by Remazol brilliant blue R (89.6%), Remazol brilliant violet 5R (84.2%)
   and Remazol Black B (77.8%). Further Remazol brilliant orange 3R is
   studied for the remediation of real wastewater and also continuous
   remediation of dyes is performed. The present work aspires to find the
   best regenerant for dye loaded biochars. From the investigation
   NaOH(0.01 M) is found to be the best elutant for all the three different
   biochars. Desorption efficiency for U. lactuca biochar loaded remazol
   dyes were between 99.3 to 99.7%, U. reticulate biochar loaded remazol
   dyes were between 99.4 to 99.8% and for C. scalpelliformis biochar
   loaded remazol dyes were between 99.2 to 99.6%. The impacts of S/L ratio
   on the elution efficiency of NaOH towards dye-bounded biochar were
   examined. The results indicated that elution efficiency of NaOH remain
   unaltered until S/L ratio=5 and additional enhancement of S/L ratio
   caused significant decrease in elution efficiency for all systems.

AB In this study, brackish water recovery from a real reactive dyeing
   textile effluent for reuse of water and salt was investigated. With the
   aim of improving the overall retention of species that are partly
   retained in a single stage, three different two-stage ultrafiltration
   scenarios were considered: 5 kDa followed by 5 kDa, 5 kDa followed by 2
   kDa and 2 kDa followed by 2 kDa. The 2 kDa + 2 kDa scenario reduced the
   total organic carbon (TOC) from 239 +/- 9 mg/L to 41 +/- 7 mg/L, at 2
   bar of transmembrane pressure (TMP) until a volume reduction factor
   (VRF) of 2.5, while color was reduced to less than 1% of the feed. The
   first stage 2 kDa at 4 bar experienced slight flux decline, however, the
   fouling was fully reversible just with physical cleaning. With this
   scenario, when the VRF was increased to 10 to increase the water
   recovery and TMP was increased to 4 bar to increase the permeate flux,
   the permeate quality remained similar, even when the pollutant load in
   the feed stream was doubled. With the 5 kDa + 2 kDa scenario, while TOC
   and color removals were somewhat less, the average first stage flux was
   about four times higher than that of the first stage 2 kDa filtration,
   although flux decline and partial fouling irreversibility were still
   observed. On the other side, the 5 kDa + 5 kDa scenario was the poorest
   in performance as 5 kDa membrane showed slightly lower retention of
   color and TOC with higher flux decline and poorer fouling reversibility;
   although the permeate flux was high. Considering the advantages of high
   retention and high flux, the permeate samples from both 2 kDa + 2 kDa
   and 5 kDa + 2 kDa scenarios were tested in fabric dyeing and found to be
   successful even with a color that is different than the color of the
   wastewater. These findings suggest that the proposed treatment scenario
   to recover salty water for reuse can be applicable for wastewater of
   changing characteristics, which is typical for textile dyeing processes.

AB In the present study, plywood dust has been used as precursor to prepare
   activated carbon and copper as impregnating agent. Two methods have been
   employed to impregnate copper in activated carbon such as carbonisation
   with solid copper chloride salt and with copper chloride solution. The
   comparative studies between these two samples on removal of both cyanide
   and phenol have showed that impregnation with solid copper chloride
   gives better result. Response surface methodology (RSM) has been
   employed to optimise carbonisation vis-a-vis copper impregnation
   condition and the sample prepared at optimum condition is termed as
   copper impregnated activated carbon (CIAC). A comparative study between
   activated carbon without impregnation, commercial activated carbon and
   CIAC has showed that CIAC is more efficient in cyanide removal than
   other two adsorbents. Kinetic study has been done with the simulated
   solution of cyanide and phenol separately with CIAC by varying solution
   concentrations and weight of the adsorbent. RSM has also been used to
   optimise the removal of cyanide and phenol from the simulated coke oven
   effluent containing phenol and cyanide in varying proportions. Finally,
   real coke oven effluent has been treated with CIAC and the percentage
   removals of both cyanide and phenol have been examined.

AB Advances in chemical synthesis have increased the complexity and
   degradation resistance of dyes used in textile processes. This fact
   interferes drastically with conventional biological wastewater treatment
   and demands further methods to avoid environmental damage. In this
   sense, this work presents a bioflocculant produced by the alkaline
   hydrolysis of spent brewer's yeast, a residue from the brewing industry,
   as well as the evaluation of its performance in the precipitation of
   recalcitrant dyes. The optimum hydrolysis system was accessed by a full
   2(3) factorial design in terms of NaOH concentration, yeast mass, and
   temperature, followed by a kinetic study. The solid fraction composition
   of the produced flocculant agent is 46 % of proteins and 29 % of
   polysaccharides. The performance of the bioflocculant was evaluated in
   two different systems, real textile wastewater containing rhodamine and
   a synthetic solution with flavine. The effects of the flocculation
   variables pH, temperature, agitation, and flocculant agent dosage were
   taken into consideration. Color removal outcomes above 80 and 90 % were
   attained for rhodamine and flavine systems, respectively. Further
   analysis of real textile wastewater for treated and untreated samples in
   terms of BOD, COD, TOC, and light metals was performed. A
   biodegradability test showed the employed treatment could increase
   microbial assimilation of the sample and reduce its persistent
   compounds. This work shows, for the first time, the feasibility of the
   bioflocculant from spent brewer's yeast and features its potential
   applicability to recalcitrant compounds precipitation in textile
   wastewaters.

   first time and applied in the photocatalytic ozonation (PCO) process.
   The efficiency of this ternary heterostructure nanocomposite was
   evaluated in the removal of Acid Blue 113 (AB113) dye with 100 mg.L-1
   concentration utilizing response surface methodology (RSM). The optimal
   condition of the process was attained at pH = 3, using 2 mg of the
   nanocatalyst and 300 mg.L-1 ozone dosage applied over 20 min. High
   efficiency of AB113 removal (99%) was observed at the optimal condition.
   In addition, the performance of the synthesized catalyst in the PCO
   process was investigated in the treatment of a real textile effluent
   sample. The PCO has been found to be more efficient than the individual
   photocatalysis and catalytic ozonation methods due to the synergistic
   effect between the two oxidation systems. The results proved that
   Fe3O4.MnO2.MoS2 can be used as a highly efficient catalyst in the PCO
   process.

AB Wastewater produced by the textile industry is a large percentage of
   total wastewater subjected to treatment processes. This paper presents
   the results of research on the use of ultrafiltration composite graphene
   oxide (GO)/polyacrylonitrile (PAN) membranes (containing 0.8% (membrane
   A), 4.0% (membrane B), 7.7% w/w (membrane C) of GO in PAN matrix) for
   removal of dyes from synthetic sewage and real laundry wastewater.
   Cationic dyes (Indigo synthetic - IS; Methylene blue - MB) and anionic
   dyes (Thymol blue -TB; Congo red - CR) were selected for the study.
   During testing of the flow of synthetic sewage through membranes, it was
   shown that TB and CR did not impair the transport properties of GO/PAN
   membranes, which for subsequent GO/PAN membranes were: similar to 24,
   congruent to 35, and similar to 58 L/m(2) h bar, respectively. On the
   other hand, decrease of permeate flux was noted for synthetic sewage
   containing the IS and MB cationic dyes. The investigation of actual
   laundry wastewater showed a reduction in volumetric permeate flux by:
   35% (membrane A), 61% (membrane B), and 50% (membrane C). The GO/PAN
   composite membranes could be used to remove anionic dyes, because they
   effectively (in nearly 100%) removed TB and CR, while cationic dyes (IS
   and MB) were separated in 60% o 95%.

AB Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) supported over halloysite nanoclay
   (ZnO/HS) were investigated for the removal of Orange G (OG) dye in
   simulated water and real water samples. This study aimed to synthesize
   ZnO NPs/HS to photo-catalytically degrade OG dye in the aforementioned
   water samples. In addition to establishing the kinetics and
   thermodynamics of the reaction. Surface and physicochemical
   characterizations affirmed the ZnO NPs/HS were mesoporous (61.0 m(2)
   g(-1)) with the rod-shaped nanoparticles homogeneously dispersed over
   the surface of HS. Employment of ZnO/HS at a mass ratio of 3:47 (w/w)
   degraded the highest quantity of the dye, amounting to a mass loss of
   >100 mg in just 2 h (pH < 12). The UV-irradiated and direct
   sunlight-activated photodegradation of aqueous OG dye by ZnO/HS followed
   a first-order kinetic model with the latter exhibiting a higher rate
   constant (4.87 x 10(-3) min(-1)). Meanwhile, values of Delta G (-4.60 kJ
   mol(-1)), Delta H (+42.8 kJ mol(-1)), and Delta S (+159 J mol(-1) K-1)
   indicated that the ZnO/HS-UV-irradiated photodegradation process was
   entropically driven. The ZnO NPs/HS photocatalyst efficiently degraded
   OG dyes (49.78%-94.36%) dissolved in various real water samples, thus
   envisaging its applicability for convenient in situ photocatalytic
   treatment of contaminated water bodies.

   some toxic dyes like Brilliant Green and Acid Red from aquatic solution
   by technique of solid-phase extraction that uses Halloysite nanoclay
   eco-friendly solid phase as absorbent surface for adsorption of dye. The
   physical properties of the HNC such as scanning electron microscopy,
   transmission electron microscope, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy, and surface area analysis were studied. The best
   conditions like pH of the solution, HNC weight, contact shaking time,
   the temperature of the solution, and ionic strength were investigated
   for removal effectiveness. The experimental data of the adsorption
   process showed that HNC can remove most of the dyes within 30 min, with
   an adsorption capacity of 12.5 mg/g for A.R dye and 13.9 mg/g for B.G
   dye on HNC solid phase at optimum conditions. The removal process of
   dyes on HNC was studied kinetically and thermodynamically, and the data
   confirms that the pseudo-second-order kinetic model was able to describe
   the adsorption process. Thermodynamic data confirms the process was
   spontaneous andexothermic in nature for A.R dye, while was spontaneous
   and endothermic in nature for B.G dye. Finally, the effectiveness of HNC
   was inspected by removing dyes from three various real samples, and the
   results showed high performance in removing dyes on HNC for four
   consecutive cycles. (c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. on

   subsequently used for treatment of real dyeing wastewater. Mature
   aerobic granules, characterised by their consumption of loosely bound
   extracellular polymeric substances (LB-EPS), and with %GR(0.3)
   (percentage of granules with size >= 0.3 mm) that exceeded 80%, were
   formed after 94 days of operation. Scanning electron microscope (SEM)
   structural analysis of the aerobic granules pointed to the possibility
   of the occurrence of azo dye decolorisation inside the aerobic granules
   during the aerobic phase of sequencing batch reactor (SBR) cycle. The
   presence of statistically meaningful correlations between total EPS,
   tightly bound EPS (TB-EPS) - including its protein (PN) and carbohydrate
   (PS) fraction and their ratio (PN/PS) - with %GR(0.5) (percentage of
   granules with size >= 0.5 mm) and SVI30 were identified, with the
   protein component of TB-EPS having the greatest influence. A hitherto
   unreported trend of change of EPS during both the anaerobic and aerobic
   phase and COD during the anaerobic phase was observed. The aerobic
   granules were successfully adapted to real dyeing wastewater with 73%
   color removal and 68% COD removal being achieved with a cycle time Of 24
   h and ratio of anaerobic to aerobic period of 3. Measurement of
   anaerobic and aerobic color removal revealed aerobic dye decolorisation
   in the anaerobic core of the aerobic granules up to the point where the
   %GR(0.3) was above 50%. However, during the 94 days adaptation period,
   despite the increase in both total EPS and PN/PS ratio in the greater
   part of SBR operation, %GR(0.3) showed a continuous drop from 81% to
   31%. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   Langmuir, and Temkin isotherm models revealed that the adsorption data
   were best fitted to the Freundlich model (R-2 = 0.9989, n = 0.19), which
   showing multilayer adsorption of the dye on the adsorbent surface. The
   kinetic data were investigated by pseudo-first-order,
   pseudo-second-order, intra-particle diffusion, and Elovich kinetic
   models. According to obtained data, the pseudo- second-order kinetic
   model was the best model for describing the adsorption kinetic (R-2 =
   0.9999). In addition, the Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2-Asn MNPs could be easily
   recovered by an external magnet and it displayed reusability for the
   subsequent seven runs. The results of Carmoisine removal from real
   samples showed that the Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2-Asn MNPs are appropriate
   adsorbents for the elimination of this pollutant from aqueous media.

AB In this study, experiments were carried out to evaluate a direct
   nanofiltration membrane process performance in terms of flux, rejection,
   and resistance to fouling, for treating two real textile dyeing rinsing
   waters (indigo blue and sulfur black) collected from rinsing baths of
   Ksar Hellal factory (SITEX). Based on permeate flux efficiencies and
   regarding permeate quality in terms of pollutant rejections, indigo blue
   permeate presented better performances than sulfur black. During volume
   reduction factor experiments, an average of 99% reduction in turbidity,
   97% in COD removal, and a colorless permeate were observed in the case
   of indigo blue, whereas for sulfur black permeate, these rejections
   values reached only 67, 86, and 52%, respectively, in terms of
   turbidity, COD and color removal efficiencies. However, low salt
   rejection rates were obtained that did not exceed 34% for both rinsing
   effluents. These results confirm the fouling problem of NF HL membrane;
   even it presented a significant improvement in permeate quality. The
   fouling influence after NF stage was evaluated by determining
   resistances in series. Nevertheless, NF HL membrane seemed to be more
   sensitive to fouling caused by treating sulfur black effluent. Moreover,
   the irreversible fouling was more important than the reversible one, for
   both studied samples.

AB Simultaneous application of solar photo-Fenton and ozonation (SPFO) for
   the efficient treatment of real wastewaters was studied. Four different
   industrial effluents were selected for the study: landfill leachate,
   pharmaceutical effluent and two textile wastewaters, in order to
   demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed
   technology. SPFO performance was compared with individual processes
   (either solar photo-Fenton or ozonation), as well as the hybrid Fenton
   and ozonation treatment. In highly polluted wastewaters, combined
   strategies led to higher organic matter removal than O-3 and
   photo-Fenton processes applied individually. Solar light favoured
   catalyst regeneration, allowing removal efficiencies up to 67% of
   chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 62% of total organic carbon (TOC) (in
   the case of textile wastewaters) using an initial concentration of only
   10 mg Fe2+ L-1. The reduction of catalyst consumption, along with the
   absence of sludge production (since Fe2+ removal from the effluent is
   not required), led to a significant decrease in operational costs (up to
   1.22 (sic) kg(-1) COD removed) when combined Fenton and ozonation was
   applied under solar light. SPFO results in a versatile, effective and
   economically efficient technology, thus postulating as a promising
   alternative for reducing the organic load of highly polluted industrial
   effluents prior to biological treatment.

AB Abstract: In this paper, an approach to the removal of the eriochrome
   black T in an actual effluent (generated from the test to determine the
   water hardness by complexometric titra-tion) using perlite modified with
   orthophenanthroline by the adsorption technique is proposed. A
   preliminary assessment of the removal of eriochrome black T in a
   synthetic effluent (aqueous solution of eriochrome black T) was executed
   for subsequent application of the optimized con-ditions in actual
   residual water (titration residue of complexation). The removal of dye
   at pH 10, the natural pH of the actual effluent, was not significant
   reaching 8.12% of color removal, on the other hand, the removal of dye
   at pH 3 achieved the maximum color removal (100%), indicating that the
   eriochrome black T interacts more effectively with the adsorbent at
   acidic pH (pH 5 or 3), and more efficiently at pH 3. Therefore, by the
   results obtained under conditions established in this present study were
   concluded that expanded perlite (an amorphous and naturally acidic
   aluminosilicate) modified with orthophenanthroline (a Bronsted base) is
   an easy to prepare, cheap and effective material for removal of acid
   dyes (eriochrome black T) applied to residues containing eriochrome T
   black generated during practical chemistry classes.
Y4 Resumo:  Neste trabalho foi realizado o estudo da remoção do negro de
   eriocromo T em um efluente real (gerado a partir do teste para
   determinar a dureza da água por titulação complexométrica) usando a
   perlita modificada com ortofenantrolina por meio da técnica de adsorção.
   Inicialmente o estudo da remoção do negro de eriocromo T em um efluente
   sintético (solução aquosa de negro de eriocromo T) foi realizado para
   posterior aplicação das condições otimizadas em águas residuais reais
   (resíduo da titilação de complexação). A remoção do corante a pH 10, ou
   seja, pH natural do efluente real, não foi significativa atingindo o
   valor máximo de percentagem de remoção de cor de 8.12%, já a pH 3 foi
   alcançada a máxima remoção de cor (remoção de 100%), indicando que o
   negro de eriocromo T interage mais efetivamente com o adsorvente em
   valores de pH ácido (pH 5 ou 3), e mais eficientemente em pH 3. Assim,
   pode-se mencionar que a perlita expandida (um aluminossilicato amorfo e
   naturalmente ácido), modificada com ortofenantrolina (uma base de
   Bronsted), é um material fácil de preparar, barato e eficaz para a
   remoção de corantes do tipo ácido (negro de eriocromo T) em condições
   estabelecidas no presente estudo, aplicado para resíduos contendo negro
   de eriocromo T gerado durante as aulas práticas de química.

AB Performance of green treatment systems such as adsorption to treat
   textile effluents often suffers lack of longevity and efficiency due to
   the presence of complex compounds of varying reactivity. There is scope
   for improving the operational efficiency of such processes using
   real-time monitoring systems. The present study aimed to evaluate the
   performance of an activated biosorbent prepared from the leaves of
   Acalypha indica for treating textile industry effluent by simulating
   process control with real-time monitoring. Batch experiments were
   performed with synthetic and real-time dye effluents to identify the
   optimum conditions (pH = 3.0, dosage = 1.0 g/L; time = 1 h) for the
   highest adsorption capacity (6 mg g(-1) and 2 mg g(-1)). The evaluation
   of physical parameters suggested best fit for Freundlich isotherm model
   and pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The LabVIEW-based simulation
   control system enabled close monitoring of pH and temperature during the
   process. Based on the inputs, an alteration of initial pH has resulted
   in substantial reduction in chemical oxygen demand (COD) (73.91%),
   turbidity (52.43%) and total dissolved solids (TDS) (19.43%). The
   average incremental increase was highest for COD (45.80 +/- 0.06%)
   compared to TDS (10.13 +/- 0.06%) and turbidity (-1.74 +/- 0.03%) for
   varying dosage (3 g to 11 g). The proposed framework for incorporating a
   process-control-based monitoring system can help to achieve better
   performance.

AB The paper presents an experimental study regarding the treatment of a
   real textile wastewater using the spinning disc (SD) technology, either
   individually or associated with an advanced Fenton oxidation step. The
   SD efficiency was investigated by studying the color, suspended solids,
   or turbidity removals, at distinctive feeding flowrates (10-30 L/h) and
   disc rotating speeds (100-1500 rpm). The data revealed increasing
   removal trends and allowed to establish the highest removal values.
   Based on obtained experimental results, the wastewater treatment
   efficiency by SD technology was reasonably good and thus, the WW
   indicators can be improved within relatively short periods of time.
   Additionally, based on supervised learning algorithms, the study
   includes treatment modeling for turbidity and color removal, followed by
   turbidity removal optimization relying on the best learned models.
   Satisfactory results obtained with the modeling and optimization
   procedures provide useful predictions for the approached treatment
   processes. Furthermore, within this study, a Fenton oxidation process
   was applied to SD technology to minimize the color and solids content.
   The influence of pH, hydrogen peroxide and ferrous ions concentrations
   was also investigated in order to establish the highest removal
   efficiencies. Overall, the SD technology applied in textile effluents
   treatment proved to be an appropriate and efficient alternative to
   classical mechanical step applied within the primary treatment step and,
   when associated with an advanced oxidative process in the secondary
   step, rendered good improvement, namely of 62.84% and 69.46% for color
   and respectively, suspended solids removal.

AB CuO-ZnO-Pr2O3-La2O3-zeolite (CZPLz) were employed for electro-Fenton
   (CZPLz-electro-Fenton) degradation of real dyeing wastewater in an
   electrochemical reactor with an steel electrode cathode and a titanium
   ruthenium iridium electrode anode. A variety of metal oxide catalyst
   particles were synthesized by an impregnation method with zeolite as the
   carrier under the following conditions: different load materials,
   different doping ratios, different calcination temperatures, and
   different calcination times. The obtained heterogeneous catalysts were
   used to treat real dyeing wastewater using the electro-Fenton process in
   a fluidized bed and were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The electrode-gradation of real
   dyeing wastewater was performed at 30 V for 60 min. The dyeing
   wastewaters were analyzed by UV-vis spectrophotometry and the potassium
   dichromate method. The maximum decolorization ratio was 91.21%, and the
   maximum COD removal efficiency was 61.1%, and these values were obtained
   for a composite metal electrode catalyst for which the CuO, ZnO, Pr2O3
   and La2O3 amounts were present at a ratio of 50: 25: 2: 20 at 600. for 3
   h. After 5 cycles of using the composite metal electrode catalyst, the
   decolorization ratio of the real dyeing wastewater was 86.67%.
   Therefore, it can be concluded that the catalyst under the optimum
   process parameters can be used many times. Additionally, it was
   confirmed that Cu2+/Zn2+/Pr3+/La3+ cations were successfully substituted
   in the zeolite, giving rise to the changes in the catalytic activity of
   the catalyst observed by XRD and SEM analyses of the composite metal
   electrode catalyst. Hence, the results of this experiment could
   establish a theoretical foundation for industrial applications.

AB Phytoremediation provides an ecofriendly alternative for the treatment

   explore phytoremediation potential of Petunia grandiflora Juss. by using
   its wild as well as tissue-cultured plantlets to decolorize Brilliant
   Blue G (BBG) dye, a sample of dye mixture and a real textile effluent.
   In vitro cultures of P. grandiflora were obtained by seed culture
   method. The decolorization experiments were carried out using wild as
   well as tissue-cultured plants independently. The enzymatic analysis of
   the plant roots was performed before and after decolorization of BBG.
   Metabolites formed after dye degradation were analyzed using UV-vis
   spectroscopy, high-performance liquid chromatography, Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
   Phytotoxicity studies were performed. Characterization of dye mixture
   and textile effluent was also studied. The wild and tissue-cultured
   plants of P. grandiflora showed the decolorized BBG up to 86 %.
   Significant increase in the activities of lignin peroxidase, laccase,
   NADH-2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenol reductase, and tyrosinase was found
   in the roots of the plants. Three metabolites of BBG were identified as
   3-{[ethyl(phenyl)amino]methyl}benzenesulfonic acid, 3-{[methyl
   (phenyl)amino]methyl}benzenesulfonic amino acid, and
   sodium-3-[(cyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-ylideneamino)methyl]benzenesulfonate.
   Textile effluent sample and a synthetic mixture of dyes were also
   decolorized by P. grandiflora. Phytotoxicity test revealed the nontoxic
   nature of metabolites. P. grandiflora showed the potential to decolorize
   and degrade BBG to nontoxic metabolites. The plant has efficiently
   treated a sample of dye mixture and textile effluent.

   collected from tannery wastewater treatment plant (TWTP) using microwave
   heating. The sludge was mixed with ZnCl2 and lime to form a paste, which
   was inserted inside a quartz reactor and irradiated by microwave for 10
   min under N-2. After the pyrolysis, the carbonized material was refluxed
   with a 6.0 mol L-1 HCl to obtain the activated carbon (AMWCTS). The
   AMWCTS was characterized by SEM, FTIR, TGA, XRD, BET and BJH analytical
   techniques. AMWCTS has high BET surface area of 491.0 m(2) g(-1) and
   total pore volume of 0.440 cm(3) g(-1) with mesoporous pore size
   distribution.
   The studies of pH, kinetic and equilibrium for adsorption of Acid Black
   210 (AB-210) and Acid Red 357 (AR-357) leather dyes onto AMWCTS were
   investigated at 298 K. The kinetic data were best fitted to the Avrami
   kinetic model. The maximum sorption capacities of AMWCTS for AR-357 and
   AB-210 are 589.5 and 1108 mg g(-1), respectively. Finally, the AMWCTS
   was tested using simulated effluents (complex mixture of dyes),
   obtaining an adsorption efficiency of at least 93.79%, showing the
   potentiality of AMWCTS as adsorbent for treatment real effluents. (C)

AB One of the recent trends in textile wastewater treatment has become
   catalytic ozonation. The necessity of effective color removal in a short
   treatment time is a standard during industrial implementation. At the
   same time, efficient chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon
   (TOC), and toxic by-product removal are highly expected. This study
   presents the results of a catalytic ozonation treatment. Three types of
   catalysts: a metal oxide (TiO(2)as P25 by Degussa), activated carbon
   (nano-powder by Sigma, AC), and metal particles (platinum, 1% wt.
   supported on AC matrix by Sigma, Pt-AC) have been applied. The
   investigations were conducted for real industrial wastewater originated
   in textile dyeing with Reactive Black 5 dye (RB5). The experiments ran
   for the raw wastewater (without pretreatment), exposed blocking of the
   catalytic action by all used catalysts. The catalytic effect could be
   observed when catalytic ozonation was used as a polishing step after
   electrocoagulation (EC). Although the catalytic effect could be observe
   for all catalysts then, especially in the removal of colorless
   by-products, the AC was exposed as the most effective. This contributed
   to 35% and 40% of TOC and COD removal. While only 18% and 23% of TOC and
   COD were removed in the same process without AC. The decrease in
   toxicity was 30%. The results of the study revealed the complexity of
   the issue and resulted in an extensive discussion devoted to the basis
   of the catalytic activity of each catalyst.

AB A hydrolyzed polyacrylonitrile (PAN) based ultrafiltration grade hollow
   fiber membrane using sodium hydroxide having high surface potential was
   developed in this work. Efficacy of this membrane was demonstrated in
   treatment of textile effluent. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
   clearly showed that hydrolysis of PAN fibers (HPAN) made them dense.
   Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra clearly indicated the
   functional groups confirming the hydrolysis of PAN matrix. The molecular
   weight cut-off of the HPAN fibers was reduced to 5 kDa from 20 kDa of
   untreated PAN lowering the average pore radius from 3.6 to 1.8 nm. A
   decline in the water contact angle of HPAN to 54 degrees from 78 degrees
   indicated the formation of a more hydrophilic membrane. The surface zeta
   potential of the hollow fiber was lowered to -12 mV from - 2 mV
   imparting the negative potential on the membrane promoting charge-charge
   interaction between membrane pore and charged species during filtration.
   The surface roughness of the membrane was reduced almost by one order of
   magnitude after hydrolysis indicating its antifouling characteristics.
   The transport of the dyes and the electrolyte through the membrane pores
   was analyzed using Donnan steric pore model (DSPM) for a multicomponent
   system applicable for low cut off ultrafiltration. Contribution of
   various transport mechanisms, i.e., diffusion, convection and
   electro-migration was quantified. Thus, the novelty of this work
   includes (i) development of low cut off ultrafiltration grade hollow
   fibers; (ii) their application in treatment of real life effluent
   containing four reactive dyes; (iii) development of multicomponent pore
   transport model using DSPM.

AB In this work, chitosan/alginate composites were developed by the
   gelation method with the addition of different amounts of activated
   carbon produced from tannery waste (ACTW). The performance of these
   composites was verified through the adsorption of the textile dye
   Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR). A synergistic effect was observed by
   the addition of ACTW; with a specific surface area up to 45.584 m(2)/g,
   the maximum adsorption capacity was 300.96 mg/g. The synergy was due to
   the reduction in steric hindrance, with the adsorption capacity 1.2
   times higher than expected. The material was regenerated with sodium
   hydroxide for 10 cycles. The composite containing 30% ACTW (AC30) was
   applied in the treatment of real textile effluent, with 30% reductions
   in the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), 39% in the chemical oxygen
   demand (COD), 78% in turbidity, and 67% in color.

AB The presence of residual dyes and their biotransformation products in
   textile wastewater is considered the main challenge of wastewater
   treatment plants. Many biological treatment methods have been used for
   treatment of textile wastewater. However, incomplete dye mineralization
   produces colorless Aromatic Amines (AAs) which are considered
   carcinogenic and highly toxic to aquatic organisms. This study assessed
   the removal efficiency and the fate of AAs in the treatment of real
   textile wastewater by anoxic-aerobic MBR. The fate of 22 AAs in both
   aqueous and sludge phases was investigated under different Internal
   Recycle ratio (IR). Most AAs possessing one aromatic ring and an
   Electron Donating Group (EDG) such as (-NH2) and (-CH3) are highly
   biodegradable under aerobic condition (above 80%), whereas AAs with 2
   aromatic rings and strong Electron Withdrawal Group (EWG), such as azo
   bond and (-Cl) exhibited low to moderate removal efficiency (below 75%).
   The AAs increased by 91% (from 205.1 to 393.7 ng/L) in the anoxic tank
   (IR = 2.0), owing to the unique bacterial diversity under high IR
   operation scheme. On the other hand, AAs in the anaerobic tank (IR =
   0.0) increased by 6.1% (from 489.26 to 519.1 ng/L), whereas, the AAs in
   the aerobic tank remained constant at 50 ng/L in both cases. Most of AAs
   accumulated in sludge under reducing condition due to the refractory
   behavior of AAs in this environment, whereas hydrophobic AAs were
   slightly accumulated in aerobic sludge.

AB Water pollution by industrial sector is a great problem which hampers
   the sustainable development goals. Dye containing water effluent poses
   vast challenge to clean water before its discharge in to the surrounding
   ecosystem. Herein, we prepared humic acid functionalized Fe3O4
   nanosorbents through an eco-friendly route and applied for
   decolorization of carcinogenic dye from water. The nanosorbents was
   characterized by AFM, BET surface area analyzer, FTIR, SEM-EDX, TEM,
   TGA/DTG, VSM and XRD. Adsorption experiments were conducted by taking
   the appropriate amount of dye in different sources of water under
   ultrasonication. Adsorption process was controlled by chemisorption in
   nature making pseudo-second-order model most suitable. Multilayer
   adsorption was taking place on the active sites of nanosorbents showing
   applicability of Freundlich isotherm model with highest adsorbed amount
   of 199.986 mg g(-1) at 323 K. Rise in temperature favors the remediation
   of colored effluent thus positive value of Delta H degrees (74.234 kJ
   mol(-1)) and negative value of Delta G degrees shows endothermic and
   spontaneous nature of adsorption system. Cationic surfactant CTAB favors
   the adsorption (<80%) while anionic SDS gives very low removal (>48%)
   because of the micelle formation at the surface of nanosorbents.
   Decolorization from real water samples shows that the adsorption of
   malachite green was 97, 90, 91, 87, and 86% for Ganga river water, tap
   water, well water, hand pump water and submersible water, respectively.
   The used Fe3O4/HA nanosorbents was easily recycled from water samples
   through 0.1 M HCl and nanosorbents was used up to five cycles with
   greater percentage of removal at 85%. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   clearly indicated that, removal efficiencies about 42% and 52%, in terms
   of COD, were achieved with BDD and Ti/Pt anodes, respectively.
   Conversely, Ti/Ru0.3Ti0.7O2 anode reached up to 85% of organic matter
   elimination, as consequence of the efficient production of active
   chlorine species (ClO, ClO2, Cl-2) by the catalytic action of the anode
   during the electrochemical treatment.

AB Kaolin, cordierite, and calcite are investigated as supports for TiO2.
   The prepared TiO2/support samples are examined for the removal of
   organic dyes from wastewater. The samples are preliminarily investigated
   to identify the optimal loaded system using synthetic wastewater
   containing methylene blue (MB). Data indicate that the investigated
   support significantly affects the photocatalytic activity of the
   supported TiO2. Low photocatalytic activity toward MB degradation is
   observed upon using TiO2/calcite when compared to the unsupported TiO2.
   Interaction between calcite and titania species probably occurrs to
   produce the less photoactive CaTiO3 amorphous species. Anatase TiO2 is
   obtained upon using kaolin and cordierite as supports. The low
   photocatalytic performance of the TiO2/kaolin sample is also observed. A
   high concentration of MB on TiO2/kaolin surfaces blocks the photoactive
   sites. TiO2/cordierite shows the highest photocatalytic activity
   compared to the unsupported TiO2 as well as the other TiO2/support
   samples. Rigid cordierite particles suppress the agglomeration of TiO2
   particles during the preparation, leading to a high exposed surface of
   TiO2 towards light illumination. TiO2/cordierite is investigated for the
   removal of organic dye from real wastewater collected from a textile
   dyeing factory. Color removal of up to 46% is achieved upon UV
   irradiation.

AB Wastewater discharge is a matter of concern as it is the primary source
   of water pollution. Consequently, wastewater treatment plays a key role
   in reducing the negative impact that wastewater discharge produce into
   the environment. Particularly, the effluents produced by textile
   industry are composed of high concentration of hazardous compounds such
   as dyes, as well as having high levels of chemical and biological oxygen
   demand, suspended solids, variable pH, and high concentration of salt.
   Main efforts have been focused on the development of methods consuming
   less water or reusing it, and also on the development of dyes with a
   better fixation capacity. However, the problem of how to treat these
   harmful effluents is still pending. Different treatment technologies
   have been developed, such as coagulation-flocculation, adsorption,
   membrane filtration, reverse osmosis, advanced oxidation, and biological
   processes (activated sludge, anaerobic-aerobic treatment, and membrane
   bioreactor). Concerning to biological treatments, even though they are
   considered as the most environmentally friendly and economic methods,
   their industrial application is still uncertain. On the one hand, this
   is due to the costs of treatment plants installation and, on the other,
   to the fact that most of the studies are carried out with simulated or
   diluted effluents that do not represent what really happens in the
   industries. Integrated treatment technologies by combining the
   efficiency two or more methodologies used to be more efficient for the
   decontamination of textile wastewater, than treatments used separately.
   The elimination of hazardous compounds had been reported using
   combination of physical, chemical, and biological processes. On this
   way, as degradation products can sometimes be even more toxic than the
   parent compounds, effluent toxicity assessment is an essential feature
   in the development of these alternatives. This article provides a
   critical view on the state of art of biological treatment, the degree of
   advancement and the prospects for their application, also discussing the
   concept of integrated treatment and the importance of including toxicity
   assays to reach an integral approach to wastewater treatment.

AB In the present work, the simultaneous adsorption of Remazol Red 3BS
   (reactive dye) and Cr(VI) onto chitosan powder grafted with
   poly(ethylene imine) and cross-linked with epichlorohydrin is
   experimentally studied. Such a combination of a dye molecule and a heavy
   metal can be found in real/practical conditions of environmental
   pollutants' removal, so their mutual interaction on the adsorption
   efficiencies is very important. The experimental data revealed a
   competitive type of interaction between the dye molecule and heavy metal
   ion. An attempt is made to quantitatively describe the data through
   appropriate isotherms and kinetic equations. The data demonstrated that
   the common thermodynamic equilibrium is not obtained for the present
   problem and the final composition of the adsorbed phase depends also on
   the kinetics. A new scenario of irreversible kinetic-based equilibrium
   was introduced and examined in detail. None of the scenarios considered
   here is fully able to cover the whole data, so semi-empirical equations
   are introduced for their description. It is shown that further
   development of phenomenological models requires more complicated
   experimental protocols than simple simultaneous adsorption of the
   species. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   demonstrated that aerogel has a typical structure of amorphous materials
   and presented a randomly interconnected porous structure that resembles

   satisfactorily described the adsorption kinetics, and the Freundlich
   model was suitable to represent the adsorption equilibrium. The maximum
   experimental capacity achieved was 227.11 mg g(-1), which indicates that

AB Textile industries present notable environmental problems related mainly
   to the use and management of water resources. The application of
   advanced oxidation technologies (AOT) to a real and complex system was
   analyzed. The degradation of a real textile effluent in the presence of
   commercial steel wool (CSW, zero-valent iron) and H2O2  as oxidant was
   studied. The effects of H2O2  concentration (0-0.08 mol L-1), mass of
   CSW (0-0.4 g L-1) and temperature (15-45 degrees C) on the reduction of
   the chemical oxygen demand (COD) of the textile effluent were evaluated.
   Kinetic studies were performed at laboratory and pilot scales at
   different temperatures under optimal conditions (0.037 mol L-1 of H2O2 
   and 0.247 g L-1 of CSW). Iron species (Fe2+, Fe3+ total Fe) were
   quantified in solution for different experiments as a function of time.
   COD reductions of 87.69% at lab scale and 89.55% at optimized pilot
   scale in 300 min (140.66 mgO(2) L-1 of COD, final discharge) were
   obtained. A metallurgical residue was tested as iron source, obtaining
   high COD removal (65%). Operating costs were calculated. Phytotoxicity
   tests performed before and after treatment showed that the effluent
   treated under optimal conditions was non-toxic.

AB Understanding the factors that specify the fouling development in
   membrane distillation (MD) plays a key role to develop effective control
   strategies with the aim of providing its widespread use in industrial
   applications, such as textile industry. The present study investigated
   the fouling mechanisms in textile wastewater treatment by direct contact
   MD (DCMD), employing an advanced in-situ optical coherence tomography
   (OCT) technology allowing to monitor MD fouling in real-time. The OCT
   analysis enabled evaluating the effect of feed temperature, flow rate,
   dye concentration on the membrane fouling and the long-term performance
   of MD operation that includes a periodical water flushing. The permeate
   flux decrease during the initial stages of experiments was attributed to
   the existence of attractive hydrophobic-hydrophobic interaction between
   the membrane and dye molecules as no cake fouling was observed at the
   early stages. Then, a flat and homogeneous cake layer was developed with
   time in all the fouled membranes regardless of the cake layer thickness.
   The long-term experiment resulted in both reversible and irreversible
   fouling and showed that water flushing had limited efficacy against
   reversible fouling. Additionally, electrostatic repulsive forces
   occurring between the membrane and textile dye molecules influenced the
   permeate flux depending on the dye concentration. Finally, among all the
   operating parameters, feed temperature had the highest impact on the
   membrane fouling and process performance, changed the heat transfer
   activity at the membrane-liquid frontier zone, in turn, leading to
   variations in the flux.

AB In this report, temperature-sensitive magnetic ionic liquids (MILs) were
   discovered for the first time. Two polypropylene glycol 400 (PPG400)
   based temperature-sensitive MILs were synthesized, characterized and
   successfully applied to construct the first reported
   temperature-sensitive magnetic ionic liquid aqueous two-phase system
   (MILATPs). To the best of our knowledge, this proposed
   temperature-sensitive MILATPs combined the advantages of rapid
   extraction, organic solvent free for the whole process, magnetic
   separation and thermorecovery of MIL in a separation process for the
   first time. Temperature-sensitive MILATPs were successfully applied for
   the removal and recovery of three triphenylmethane dyes from wastewater.
   Phase behaviors and several influencing factors on dye extraction
   efficiency were detailedly investigated and optimized with good
   performances. Both high purities of MIL and dye could be ideally
   recovered simply by heating and the recoveries of dyes were higher than
   93%. Additionally, the two MILs could be recycled for at least 6 times
   with steadily high extraction efficiencies. Furthermore, this novel
   temperature-sensitive MILATPs had been successfully applied for real
   industrial dyed wastewater treatment with satisfactory recoveries of
   both MIL and dye. This novelly proposed temperature-sensitive MILATPs is
   simple and green method which is showing great potential in a
   separation-recovery process and the industrial treatment of dyed
   wastewater.

   for dye/salt separation. Optimized membranes showed high rejection for
   various dyes with <15% rejection for monovalent and divalent salts.
   Furthermore, long term testing (150 h) using real industry effluent
   revealed steady performance with excellent flux recovery and persistent

   the contacting time were examined for various adsorbents, namely green
   tea-leaf powder (GTP), black tea-leaf powder (BTP), and powdered
   activated carbon (PAC). Results from batch experiments revealed that the
   reduction in true color (ADMI) increases with decreasing pH. The ADMI
   reduced from 1106 to 150 with 0.8 g/L of GTP at pH 2. The results also
   showed following ADMI removal efficiency order: GTP > PAC >> BTP. The
   active functional groups of the tea wastes involved in the adsorptive
   decoloration of tea waste were the hydroxyl, amine, carboxyl stretching,
   and C-O groups. The work carried out has revealed that green tea waste
   has a high potential to be used as an economically viable adsorbent to

AB In this project, eriochrome black T (EBT) and methylene blue (MB) which
   are well known textile and other industries effluents pollutants were
   removed by activated carbon prepared from the plant, having no medicinal
   or other importance (stem of Buxus Wallichiana) by pyrolysis method.
   Initially, different analytical techniques were applied to describe the
   composition and morphology of the prepared activated carbon (ACs).
   Different structural analysis found that pyrolysis at 600 degrees C
   brought a significant change in chemical composition of the prepared
   ACs. EDX elucidated high carbon contents ACs was formed which is highly
   desires for adsorption process. For optimization of different conditions
   for adsorption of both the dyes, different parameters which include
   initial concentration of both the dyes, pH of dye solutions, contact
   time and temperature were investigated in batch mode. It was found from
   adsorption of dyes on the prepared ACs that maximum amount of MB and EBT
   adsorption were 866.15 mg/g and 383 mg/g respectively. Also, adsorption
   of MB on the prepared ACs was higher than commercial ACs while in case
   of EBT commercial ACs has higher adsorption value than the prepared ACs.
   Due to physisorption nature, maximum adsorption of both the dyes took
   place at low temperature. The pH at PZC for ACs was around 5.9. The
   adsorptions of the EBT and MB on the prepared ACs were exothermic in
   nature due to the -ve value of enthalpy. The reusability of the prepared
   ACs was checked, with the adsorption capacity dropping from 126 mg/g to
   103 mg/g over the course of five cycles in the real sample. These
   findings suggest that Buxus Wallichiana stem is a suitable biosorption
   substitute for the remediation of cationic (MB) and anionic (EBT) dyes
   from textile industrial effluents.

AB In this study, the selective adsorption performance of different Fe-Mn
   binary oxides (FMBOs) towards Sb(V) in the textile wastewater under
   different concentrations of coexisting anions, surfactants and dyes were
   investigated. Results showed that the influences of different anions on
   the Sb(V) removal followed an order of phosphate > carbonate > sulfate >
   nitrate > chloride. The frequently-used organic acid of acetate was
   found to have insignificant effect. The coexisting surfactant with
   sulfonic groups could have adverse effect on the removal due to sulfonic
   groups could compete the adsorptive sites on Fe oxides with Sb(V). While
   the quaternary ammonium surfactant might have minor effect. The
   influences of the three widely used dyes on the Sb(V) adsorption
   decreased in the following order: reactive black-5 >acid orange-7>
   disperse blue-60, which confirmed that the dyes with sulfonic groups
   would have relatively higher effect. The selective adsorption capacities
   of Sb(V) by FMBOs followed an order of FMBO3> FMBO5 >FMBO10> FMBO20>PFO.
   Fixed-bed column adsorption supplied useful parameters and evidently
   indicated that the cyclic utilization of FMBO3 was cost-efficient for
   practical dynamic Sb(V) removal. The Sb(V) removal by FMBO3 from real
   textile wastewater can simultaneously improve the removal efficiency,
   stabilize pH and prevent the increase of iron concentration as compared
   to the traditional coagulation, further demonstrating the high practical
   applicability of FMBO3. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A pilot-scale vertical flow constructed wetland (VFCWs) system was
   designed, implemented and operated for one year for the treatment of
   dye-rich real textile effluent. Brachiaria mutica was vegetated to
   develop VFCWs in which five different textile effluent degrading
   endophytic bacteria were inoculated. These bacteria were screened based
   on their dye degrading and plant growth promoting capabilities. The
   system's performance was evaluated by monitoring physicochemical
   parameters, nutrients removal, heavy metals reduction, detoxification
   potential, and persistence of endophytic bacteria in the plant rhizo-and
   endosphere. Although VFCWs were able to remove a majority of the
   pollutants from the wastewater, bacterial augmentation further enhanced
   the remediation efficiency. The system promoted an increase in dissolved
   oxygen up to 188% and, concomitantly, a substantial decrease in the
   chemical oxygen demand (81%), biochemical oxygen demand (72%), total
   dissolved solids (32%), color (74%), nitrogen (84%), phosphorous (79%),
   and heavy metals [Cr(97%), Fe(89%), Ni(88%), Cd (72%)] was recorded.
   Wastewater treated with VFCWs augmented with bacteria was found to be
   non-toxic and inoculated bacteria showed persistence in the root and
   shoot interior of B. mutica. Conclusively, VFCWs proved to be an
   effective methodology for treatment of textile effluent whereas its
   smaller size with high efficiency is an advantage for field-scale
   applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   clay on the hydrophilicity, permeability, morphology, and antifouling
   properties of the fabricated membranes was investigated. It was observed
   that incorporating kaolin particles improved the mechanical properties
   but decreased the contact angle of the membranes, thereby resulting in
   an improvement in the membrane permeability. The performance of the
   three composite UF membranes was evaluated through the treatment of a
   real textile effluent sample containing indigo dye. The results
   confirmed that these membranes are effective in the removal of COD,
   color, and turbidity. Indeed, at a transmembrane pressure of 2.5 bar,
   almost total removal of the turbidity, COD removal > 85%, and color
   removal > 97% were attained. Furthermore, membrane A85 (with 85% clay)
   showed the best performance, with a water flux of 659.1 L center dot

   potential of incorporating low-cost clay material for the enhancement of

   pilot-scale DM system for deep purification of the secondary textile
   effluent, which aimed at verifying the technical and economic
   feasibility of the DM with real secondary textile effluent. The
   hydrodynamic experiments indicated that the filtration resistance
   gradually increased along with the operation of DM system, and among
   which, the PAC size was the most important influencing factor. More
   dosage and smaller sized PAC were beneficial to enhance the purification
   effect of micro-organic pollutants, but they simultaneously improved the
   operational costs, which implied that the adoption of DM materials
   should comprehensively consider the removal results and the type and
   dosage of DM materials for obtaining an optimal result, and the
   operational costs would be drastically reduced by regenerating the
   wasted PAC. More than 50% residual micro-organic pollutants were further
   removed by the system, and they were mainly some aliphatic and aromatic
   compounds, which were the main refractory organic pollutants in most
   textile effluents. It was also proved by the pilot-scale DM study that
   the removed residual pollutants from the secondary textile effluent were
   mainly aromatic protein II. Due to the contained complex functional
   groups in their molecular structure, soluble microbial metabolites were
   relatively easier to be removed by the DM layer.

   processes. The present study comprehensively reviews the efficacy of
   agro-biomass/byproducts (belonging to plants, microbes and animals)
   either as biosorbents (raw biomass) or adsorbents (modified biomass) for
   direct removal of dyes and their role as co-substrate to stimulate the
   biodegradation/decolourization of dyes by bacteria and fungi. In
   physiochemical process, agrobased biosorbents/adsorbents with porous
   structures and cellulosic content (>= 40%) could exhibit excellent
   potential for removal of both ionic and non-ionic dyes from aqueous
   medium. Advancement of chemically modified agro-wastes in the form of
   bio-composites, or doped with nano-materials are used to enhance the
   sorption of dyes from wastewater in column-flow mode. In biological
   processes, co-substrate such as jack-fruit seed-powder, sago-waste, and
   molasses can act as e over bar -donor, nutritional supplement, and
   solid-phase substratum for bacteria in dye decolourization medium, which
   reduces the color and organic loading in bio-treated water. Such
   low-cost agro-based co-substrates could be used in bioreactors for
   biodegradation of dyes and coupled bioenergy production at industrial
   scale. However, it is required to investigate the potential of
   biosorbent for real dyeing-wastewater treatment, comprehensive economic
   analysis of the agro-based bio-treatment process, a suitable solid-phase
   co-substrate for immobilization of microorganism to reduce sludge, and
   reusability of agrowastes for effective treatment of wastewater.

AB To understand adsorption property of bagasse carbon-red mud (BCRM), a
   low-cost adsorption material prepared from waste solid red mud and
   bagasse, for disposal of organic dyes in wastewater, the adsorption of
   methylene blue (MB) from aqueous solution on BCRM has been studied, and
   the adsorption treatment of real textile wastewater was also
   investigated. Characterization of BCRM was achieved by scanning electron
   microscope and nitrogen adsorption-desorption analysis. Effects of
   adsorption time, BCRM dosage, initial concentration, temperature, and
   initial pH on the adsorption of MB were explored. From the
   characterization of adsorbent, it can be seen that the prepared BCRM was
   a porous material composed of particles with rough surface and loose
   structure, and an excellent mesoporous material with high specific
   surface area and good mesopore structure. The adsorption results showed
   that the data fitted better with pseudo-second-order kinetic model (R-2
   = 0.9995) than pseudo-second- order kinetic and intraparticle diffusion
   models. Langmuir model was better fit isotherm for MB adsorption on BCRM
   than Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevich adsorption isotherms. It can be
   drawn that MB adsorption on BCRM was a monolayer adsorption and the
   adsorption occurred at specific homogeneous sites on the adsorbent. The
   results of adsorption thermodynamics indicated MB adsorption on BCRM was
   a spontaneous, endothermic, and physical process. The adsorption
   treatment of real textile wastewater by BCRM implied BCRM was an
   effective and regenerable adsorbent for removal of dye from wastewater.

AB This paper describes the successful use of thin films of birnessite to
   remediate aqueous solutions containing indigo carmine (IC) dye. This
   latter is one of the oldest and most important dyes used and released in
   the effluents of many industries, such as textile, paper and plastics.
   Moreover, this anionic dye belongs to a highly toxic class of dyes
   (indigoid). We show that thin films of birnessite. electrodeposited onto
   a cheap transparent semiconductor substrate (SnO2), can totally discolor
   the IC solutions at room temperature after only 1 h in the best
   conditions. The mass spectrometry analyses reveal the presence of
   intermediate reaction products (m/z = 226 amu, m/z = 244 amu and m/z =
   216 amu) during interaction confirming the real degradation of dye.
   Moreover, nitrate and ammonium ions are quantified showing that thin
   films of birnessite can degrade totally (mineralise) and spontaneously
   more than 60% of indigo carmine into these mineral species after 24 h in
   the best conditions. These results confirm that birnessite thin films
   appear as a very interesting material for the development of a simple
   and ecological method of wastewater remediation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

   degraded 75-80% in 1 h. For the first time, a dithiocarbamate fungicide
   thiram is degraded to give thiourea as a product in 1 h. Photocatalysis
   follows pseudo-first order kinetics with rate 3.67, 49.50 and 3.19 times

AB The adsorption potential of a nonliving alga Nostoc comminutum for the
   removal of hazardous dyes from aqueous solutions was assessed. The algal
   biomass in its native form exhibited the highest dye removal efficiency
   at a pH of 1 and at a contact time of 50 min. The effect of various
   chemical pretreatments was studied in order to assess the role of
   surface chemistry and the underlying mechanism. Combined with Fourier
   transform infrared (FTIR) studies, it was concluded that the carboxylic
   and amine groups played a dominant role in the dye binding process. pH
   studies further revealed that besides the electrostatic mechanism, other
   physical interactions might be operative, which is also revealed from
   the Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) isotherm model. Kinetic studies indicated
   that the adsorption process followed the second-order kinetics and
   particle diffusion mechanisms were operative. Thermodynamic studies
   revealed that the adsorption of two dyes onto the algal biomass was
   feasible, spontaneous, and exothermic under the studied conditions.
   Microwave irradiation was proposed as a green method for the
   regeneration and reuse of the biomass. A 16% loss in the regeneration
   efficiency of the biosorbent was observed, which reveals its stability
   and reuse potential. Column experiments with real textile wastewater
   established the practicality of the developed system. Finally, a
   comparative study revealed the efficacy of the biosorbent with other
   previously reported biosorbents for dye removal.

AB Industrial activities generate considerable volumes of wastewater
   containing organic and inorganic contaminants. Adsorption is an
   efficient method for wastewater treatment due to its ease of operation,
   convenience, and efficiency. However, finding suitable adsorbent
   materials that are abundant, cheap, and efficient remains a challenge.
   Gelatin is considered a promising adsorbent due to its abundant surface
   of active groups, water solubility, non-toxicity, and biodegradability.
   Also, gelatin allows the addition of other compounds in the gel network,
   overcoming some disadvantages such as low mechanical resistance to
   temperature and humidity. Here we review the production of gelatin-based
   composites including beads/spheres, hydrogels, aerogels, and films, and
   their use to remove toxic metals, dyes, nitrate, phosphate, and oily
   contaminants from aqueous matrices. Considerations Economic,
   environmental, and real applications aspects are also discussed.

   hexyl has been synthesized. The resin has been utilized as a sorbent for
   the simultaneous removal of Cr(III) as well as several organic dyes from
   aqueous solutions. At an initial Cr(III) concentration of 1.0 ppm, the
   metal uptake was almost approximate to 100% in 20 min at pH 5 and 25
   degrees C. The experimental results were evaluated by Langmuir,
   Freundlich, and Temkin isotherm models. By using 0.1 M HNO3 solution,
   the adsorbed Cr(III) ions were desorbed effectively. Interestingly, the
   resin demonstrated remarkable efficacy in simultaneous and complete
   removal of Cr(III) and several dyes including methyl orange, eriochrome
   black T, rhodamine B, methyl red and methylene blue from their mixture.
   The resin has also been remarkably effective in the removal of several
   toxic metal ions from a real industrial wastewater. As such, the resin
   may have applications for international environmental management in the
   water technology.

   Oxygen Demands (COD) reductions in CBB of about 42%, meanwhile tests on
   real effluents from a local textile industry involved COD reductions of
   50% in a liquid wastewater and 14% in semi-liquid sludge. Thus, allow

AB Synthetic dyes from liquid waste can harm people or the environment,
   even at low concentrations. This research investigated the utilisation
   of Terminalia catappa (TC) shell as biosorbent in the removal of Indigo
   carmine (IC) dye from aqueous solution. TC shell was modified by soaking
   in 0.01 M nitric acid for two hours. The biosorbent characterised by
   Fourier Transform Infra-Red Spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray Fluorescence
   spectroscopy (XRF), Scanning Electron Microscope with Energy Dispersive
   Spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis. Batch
   experiments carried out at a biosorbent particle size of <= 36 mu m and
   100 rpm of agitation speed. The optimum conditions for TC shell
   biosorption of IC were at pH 2, contact time 30 min, and an initial
   concentration of 600 mg L-1. The adsorption capacity of the biosorbent
   for IC was 26.77 mg g(-1). The kinetic and isotherm study of IC dye
   biosorption revealed that the pseudo-second-order model and Freundlich
   isotherm were the best fit. Thermodynamic parameters for the biosorption
   showed that the process was spontaneous and exothermic. The removal
   efficiency only dropped from 73 % to 64 % after 3 cycles of use using 30
   % glycerol as eluent. The removal efficiency of IC dye from the real
   wastewater using TC shells was 60.13 %. The results indicated that TC
   shell was a potential biosorbent to reduce IC concentration in aqueous
   solutions.

AB Methylene blue dye (MB) was degraded photocatalytically in aqueous
   solution using Ag+ doped TiO2 under UV irradiation. The degradations of
   the dye using untreated TiO2 and Ag+ doped TiO2 were compared. Ag+ doped
   TiO2 was found to be more efficient. Using Ag+ doped TiO2 the filtration
   process was eliminated, as the particles became more settleable. The
   effect of various parameters such as catalyst loading, initial dye
   concentration, depth of solution, degree of adsorption, pH and O-2 on
   dye degradation was studied. The extent of mineralization was studied by
   observing the COD removal at different time intervals. The effects of
   various interfering ions such as Cl-, NO3-, CO32-, SO42-, Ca2+ and Fe3+
   and electron acceptors such as H2O2, KBrO3 and (NH4)(2)S2O8 on the dye
   degradation was also studied. The degradation kinetics fitted well to
   Langmuir-Hinshelwood pseudo first order rate law. An aqueous solution of
   MB (20ppm) degraded by more than 99% after UV irradiation for 180 min
   with Ag+ doped TiO2 (2 g/L) and by more than 95% with untreated TiO2 (2
   g/L). The COD removal was more than 91% with Ag+ doped TiO2 and more
   than 86% with untreated TiO2 after 240 min. The degradation and COD

AB A new adsorbent derived from the skin of Cucumis melo var. cantalupensis
   (CMS) through surface modification with 1 M NaOH (MCMS) was investigated
   for its enhanced ability to adsorb methyl violet 2B (MV 2B) dye. The
   optimum contact time for both CMS and MCMS to reach equilibrium was at
   90 min. The effect of pH indicated that dye removal at higher pH was
   comparable with the untreated pH. The pseudo-second-order model best
   described the adsorption kinetics data for both CMS and MCMS. The Sips
   isotherm model fitted the adsorption process with maximum adsorption
   capacity (q(ma)(x)) of 224.56 and 669.73 mg g(-1) for CMS and MCMS,
   respectively, indicating that simple surface modification of CMS with
   NaOH significantly enhanced the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent
   toward MV 2B by approximately 200%. Further, it is found that the
   removal of MV 2B by MCMS was not affected by ionic constituents as much
   as CMS, demonstrating the superior characteristics of MCMS. Regeneration
   and reuse of both spent adsorbents are possible, especially when washed
   with acid. Overall, based on the high q(max) values as compared with
   those of many reported adsorbents, both CMS and MCMS are potentially
   strong adsorbents for the removal of MV 2B dye in real-life wastewater
   treatment.

AB In this study, a real textile effluent (RTE) was treated by the
   electro-Fenton method in a parallel plate reactor. A carbon fiber
   cathode and a stainless-steel mesh anode were used as electrodes. The
   effluent was characterized, and dilute solutions were prepared with
   initial chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentrations of 50, 100, 200,
   250, and 300 ppm. The prepared effluents were degraded for 180 min, at
   an applied voltage of 1.8 V and a current density of 0.45 mAcm(-2).
   Reductions of more than 85 % of the initial color and 55 % of the COD
   were achieved. The energy consumption was 7 kW h kgCOD(-1) removed. The
   RTE degradation followed pseudo-first-order kinetics, and its rate
   constants ranged from 0.01 to 0.02 min(-1). It was observed that the
   degradation rate decreased as the initial effluent concentration
   increased.
   Based on the kinetic results, a methodology was developed to predict the
   effluent degradation. For each kinetic equation, the empirical constant
   (a) and the rate constant (k) were determined. Mathematical models were
   formulated for a and k, relative to their respective CODi
   concentrations, with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.95 in both
   cases. The theoretical values of a(t) and k(t) for the working
   concentrations were calculated using the formulated mathematical models.
   The theoretical parameters were substituted into the first-order kinetic
   equation, allowing the simulation of the RTE degradation. The
   degradation behavior was simulated for each of the five concentrations
   studied, and the results compared with the experimental results. The
   theoretical and experimental values showed a high degree of adjustment,
   demonstrating that the proposed methodology was successful in predicting
   the degradation of the textile effluent.

AB Multistage Fenton oxidation is a favored method for the treatment of
   benzene dye intermediate (BDI) wastewater, but the pH adjustments
   required after each stage of the Fenton process with a simple way is
   still a challenge. Limestone pretreatment and lime
   neutralization-coagulation were used to solve the problem in multistage
   Fenton process. First, we determined the optimal conditions of Fenton
   oxidation using the Box-Behnken response surface method. Limestone
   pretreatment before the multistage Fenton process allowed for
   simultaneous pH adjustment and 14.15% COD removal. Most notably, the
   lime cream neutralization-coagulation process effectively adjusted the
   pH after each stage of the Fenton process. The optimum CaO particle
   size, lime mass fraction, mixing time, and stirring speed were
   determined by orthogonal tests. COD removal (89.23%) was obtained when
   lime cream neutralization-coagulation was applied to the three-staged
   Fenton process, while only 58.57% COD removal was obtained by the
   unadjusted single-staged Fenton process. The COD and wastewater color
   were reduced from 10,600 mg/L and 12,200 multiples to 495 mg/L and 20
   multiples, respectively, using the adjusted process. This improved
   method provides a promising cost-effective way to efficiently treat real
   BDI wastewater.

AB This paper reports the results obtained using the sequencing batch
   biofilter granular reactor (SBBGR) for the treatment of the wastewater
   from a dyeing and finishing factory. The treatment of such a wastewater
   is challenging as it usually contains considerable amounts of different
   recalcitrant, toxic and inhibitory pollutants, which results in low
   biodegradability and in the need for numerous treatment steps. Different
   operational conditions were tested in order to assess SBBGR performance
   as a function of the applied organic and hydraulic load and to verify
   its suitability for on-site dyeing wastewater treatment at each factory.
   The reported measurements demonstrate how this innovative biological
   technology exhibits various promising features for this purpose, as good
   treatment efficiencies can be achieved even at high organic load values
   (2.4-2.6 kg(COD) m(-3) d(-1)) and with hydraulic retention times lower
   than one day. Furthermore, the treatment is characterized by a sludge
   production as low as 0.1 kg of dry sludge per kg of COD removed.
   Therefore, SBBGR has proved to be an effective pre-treatment for dyeing
   textile wastewater before discharge into municipal sewer system, as it
   produces a suitable effluent using just only one biological step with
   high hydraulic and organic loadings and low sludge production. (C) 2012

AB A BDD-batch reactor with recirculation is presented, for the first time,
   to the electrochemical treatment of an actual cashew-nut effluent, which
   is a real environmental problem in the Northeast region of Brazil. This
   system was characterized in terms of mass transfer coefficient (k(m) =
   2.22 x 10(-5) m s(-1)), which led to a limiting current intensity of
   1.91 A. Different parameters, such as, current density, kind of
   electrolyte and initial pH were evaluated considering the chemical
   oxygen demand removal, current efficiency, energy consumption,
   by-products generation and toxicity. The results clearly indicated that
   the addition of external electrolyte and the change of initial pH are
   two factors that do not lead to a significant improvement in the
   degradation of organic matter when compared to the treatment of the
   effluent as received. Conversely, an increase in current density
   promoted a COD removal up to 89%, after 150 min of oxidation, due to the
   enhancement of the generation rate of strong oxidants. Low production of
   carboxylic acids was also detected over time. Additionally, it seems
   that the treated effluent can be used to irrigate specific crops, like
   those applied to the production of renewable fuels, based on the
   toxicity tests performed. (C) 2018 The Electrochemical Society.

AB Due to their large-scale production and extensive application, dyes have
   turned serious pollutants when improperly handled and disposed, creating
   grave public health and environmental problems. One of the problems that
   textile industry is facing is related with the incomplete exhaustion of
   dyes onto textile fibres from an aqueous dyeing process, and the need to
   implement innovative and sustainable effluent treatment methods to
   remove colour. Additionally, legislation on the limits of colour
   discharge has turn increasingly rigid. Biological treatment systems have
   been shown as promising technologies. The main limiting factor of the
   reductive transformations by anaerobic sludge is the electron transfer,
   a slow process. This limitation can be overcome by making use of redox
   mediators, which are compounds that accelerate the electron transfer
   from a primary electron donor to a terminal electron acceptor, to speed
   up the process. Activated carbon (AC) has been shown as a feasible redox
   mediator. Samples of microporous thermal treated AC (AC(H2)) and
   mesoporous carbons: xerogels (CXA, CXB) and carbon nanotubes (CNT) were
   tested on azo dye and textile wastewater biodegradation. similar to 85%
   Mordant Yellow 10 (MY10) and 70% of Reactive Red 120 (RR120) colour
   removal was obtained with all the carbon materials. Acid Orange 10
   (AO10) is not biodegraded in the absence of carbon materials, but with
   CXB and CNT a 98% of colour removal was achieved. For MY10 and RR120,
   rates increased in the order: control < AC(H2) < CXA < CXB < CNT. HPLC
   analysis confirmed the reduction of dyes with the formation of
   corresponding aromatic amines. The effect of CNT was also observed in
   the biological treatment of real textile wastewaters. (C) 2013 Elsevier

   Thomas model, Adams-Bohart model, Wolborska model, Yoon-Nelson model,
   Yan et al. kinetic model, and modified dose-response model were engaged
   to illustrate the performance of the packed-bed sorption mechanism. BDST
   model explained the experimental mechanism very well. The breakthrough
   behavior was well reported by Thomas model and Yoon-Nelson model. The
   optimum bed height (10 cm) and flow rate (12 mL/min) yield maximum dye
   uptake (251.61 mg/g). The optimal conditions were adopted for the
   treatment of real textile dye effluent. The biomass S. platensis
   eliminates the chemical oxygen demand, color, and turbidity of the raw
   wastewater than pH, total solids, suspended solids, and dissolved
   solids. Hence, S. platensis can be a successful sorbent for the

AB A novel Janus sponge with the ability to remove complex contaminants
   from water is reported. Firstly, a superhydrophilic sponge
   (PA@PEI-sponge) is prepared via synthesizing negatively charged phytic
   acid@polyethyleneimine (PA@PEI) nanoparticles and assembling them on the
   surface of polydopamine (PDA) and PEImodified polyurethane (PU) sponge
   through electrostatic adsorption. The Janus sponge is generated by
   modifying one side of the PA@PEI-sponge with PDMS, which exhibits
   superior separation efficiency and high filtration flux toward both
   water-in-oil and oil-in-water emulsions due to its multiplex selective
   wettability and the interconnected and tortuous 3D porous channels. The
   numerous negatively charged active sites of PA@PEI nanoparticles and PDA
   layer impart the superhydrophilic PA@PEI-sponge with the removal
   efficiency of 39.95 +/- 0.27% for malachite green (MG) via simple
   flow-through filtration, which can be improved to 99.92 +/- 0.07% by
   Janus modification. More importantly, the Janus sponge exhibits an
   excellent treatment capacity for complex mixtures containing emulsified
   oil and dye, with the separation efficiency above 99.59%. The Janus
   sponge also demonstrates the effective separation of real industrial
   wastewater collected from an acrylic dyeing plant. Together with a
   facile and green preparation strategy, this Janus sponge shows excellent
   application potential for simultaneous dye removal and oil/water
   emulsion separation.

AB Researchers nowadays are relentlessly on a race exploring sustainable
   materials and techniques for the sequestration of toxic dyes and metal
   ions from water bodies. Biopolymers such as guar gum, owing to its high
   abundance, low cost and non-toxicity, are potential candidates in this
   field. Plenty of hydroxyl groups in the polymer backbone enable guar gum
   to be functionalised or grafted in a versatile manner proving itself as
   an excellent starting substance for fabricating upgraded materials meant
   for diverse applications. This review offers a comprehensive coverage of
   the role of guar gum-based nanocomposites in removal of dyes and heavy
   metal ions from waste water through adsorption and photo-catalytic
   degradation. Isotherm and kinetics models, fabrication routes,
   characterisation techniques, swelling properties and reusability as well
   as adsorption and degradation mechanisms are outlined. A detailed
   analysis with convincing results suggests a good future perspective of
   implementation of these materials in real-time wastewater treatment
   technology.

AB Salvinia molesta, an aquatic fern was observed to have a potential of
   degrading azo dye Rubine GFL up to 97% at a concentration of 100 mg/L
   within 72 h using 60 +/- 2 g of root biomass. Both root as well as stem
   tissues showed induction in activities of the enzymes such as lignin
   peroxidase, veratryl alcohol oxidase, laccase, tyrosinase, catalase,
   DCIP reductase and superoxide dismutase during decolorization of Rubine
   GFL. FTIR, GC-MS, FIPLC and UV-visible spectrophotometric analysis
   confirmed phytotransformation of the model dye into smaller molecules.
   Analysis of metabolites revealed breakdown of an azo bond of Rubine GFL
   by the action of lignin peroxidase and laccase and formation of
   2-methyl-4-nitroaniline and N-methylbenzene-1, 4-diamine. Anatomical
   tracing of dye in the stem of S. molesta confirmed the presence of dye
   in tissues and subsequent removal after 48 h of treatment. The
   concentration of chlorophyll pigments like chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b
   and carotenoid was observed during the treatment. Toxicity analysis on
   seeds of Triticum aestivum and Phaseolus mungo revealed the decreased
   toxicity of dye metabolites. In situ treatment of a real textile
   effluent was further monitored in a constructed lagoon of the dimensions
   of 7mx 5 mx 2 m (total surface area 35 m(2)) using S. molesta for 192 h.
   This large scale treatment was found to significantly reduce the values
   of COD, BOD5 and ADMI by 76%, 82% and 81% considering initial values
   1185, 1440 mg/L and 950 units, respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

AB Novel manganese oxide nanocorals (MONCs) were synthesized,
   characterized, and successfully used for the removal of toxic methylene
   blue (MB), as an example of organic dyes, from a model and the real
   solution. The MONCs were characterized by XRD, scanning and
   transmittance electron microscopes, and surface area analysis. The
   results confirm the formation of MONCs as nanocrystalline orthorhombic
   gamma-MnO2 phase with nanowires with diameters between 20.0 and 40.0 nm.
   The MONCs used for the removal of MB from aqueous solution and the
   different parameters that affected the adsorption process were studied
   and optimized. The adsorption process was studied kinetically and
   thermodynamically to elucidate the removal mechanism for better
   efficiency. The results showed that the removal process followed the
   pseudo-second-order kinetics model, and the spontaneity of the
   adsorption process at ambient temperatures. Finally, MONCs were used for
   the removal of MB ions from a wastewater sample, and the result
   indicated that they were highly efficient at removing the toxic MB. (C)

AB Azo dyes impact the environment and deserve attention due to their
   widespread use in textile and tanning industries and challenging
   degradation. The high temperature, pH, and salinity used in these
   industries render industrial effluent decolorization and detoxification
   a challenging process. An enrichment technique was employed to screen
   for cost-effective biodegraders of Direct Red 81 (DR81) as a model for
   diazo dye recalcitrant to degradation. Our results showed that three
   mixed bacterial cultures achieved >= 80% decolorization within 8 h of 40
   mg/L dye in a minimal salt medium with 0.1% yeast extract (MSM-Y) and
   real wastewater. Moreover, these mixed cultures showed >= 70%
   decolorization within 24 h when challenged with dye up to 600 mg/L in
   real wastewater and tolerated temperatures up to 60 degrees C, pH 10,
   and 5% salinity in MSM-Y. Azoreductase was the main contributor to DR81
   decolorization based on crude oxidative and reductive enzymatic activity
   of cell-free supernatants and was stable at a wide range of pH and
   temperatures. Molecular identification of azoreductase genes suggested
   multiple AzoR genes per mixed culture with a possible novel azoreductase
   gene. Metabolite analysis using hyphenated techniques suggested two
   reductive pathways for DR81 biodegradation involving symmetric and
   asymmetric azo-bond cleavage. The DR81 metabolites were non-toxic to
   Artemia salina nauplii and Lepidium sativum seeds. This study provided
   evidence for DR81 degradation using robust stress-tolerant mixed
   cultures with potential use in azo dye wastewater treatment.

AB Domestic wastewater has been used as a co-substrate with real textile
   wastewater (RTW) in a novel cross-linked microbial fuel cell (CMFC)
   reactor for its treatment and bioelectricity generation. In novel CMFC,
   two H shaped MFCs were stacked hydrodynamically for providing sequential
   anaerobic and aerobic treatments in the bio-anode and bio-cathodes,
   respectively. Both MFCs are electrically connected in parallel mode to
   enhance power generation. Performance of CMFC was observed in terms of
   power generation, COD, and color removals at different blending
   percentage of RTW (20, 30, 40, and 50%) with domestic wastewater. The
   maximum blending percentage of RTW in domestic wastewater was found 40%
   optimum at their inherent pH and conductivity with 24 h hydraulic
   retention time per chamber. Further at this percentage, pH and
   conductivity of the feed were maintained at 6.4 and 8 mS cm(-1) by
   phosphate buffer solution. Under these control parameters and with
   change in organic loading rate (OLR), CMFC achieved power density, COD,
   and color removals of 337 Wm(-3), 82, and 60% respectively.
   Membrane-less-CMFC gave enhanced power density (750 Wm(-3)) but a lower
   COD (79%) and color (45%) removals in comparison to CMFC. Bio-cathode
   (aerobic treatment) also shown its potential in CMFC by removing
   aromatic amines produced at the bio-anode due to anaerobic treatment of
   azo dyes present in RTW. Adding domestic wastewater as a co-substrate
   neutralizes RTW and also provides sufficient nutrients for biological
   treatment, hence increases its treatability and reduces its treatment
   cost. CMFC also proves its potential to sustain in real-world conditions
   and can be upgraded and scaled up after further modifications.

AB The scalability of any microbial fuel cell (MFC)-based system is of
   vital importance if it is to be utilized for potential field
   applications. In this study, an integrated MFC-aerobic bioreactor system
   was investigated for its scalability with the purpose of treating a
   simulated dye wastewater and industrial wastewaters originated from
   textile dyebaths and leather tanning. The influent containing real
   wastewater was fed into the reactor in continuous mode at ambient
   temperature. Three MFC units were integrated to act in unison as a
   single module for wastewater treatment and a continuously stirred
   aerobic bioreactor operating downstream to the MFC module was installed
   in order to ensure more complete degradation of colouring agents found
   in the wastewater. Total colour removal in the final effluent exceeded
   90% in all experiments where both synthetic (AO-7 containing) and real
   wastewater were used as the influent feed. The chemical oxygen demand
   reduction also exceeded 80% in all experiments under the same
   conditions. The MFC modules connected in parallel configuration allowed
   obtaining higher current densities than that can be obtained from a
   single MFC unit. The maximum current density of the MFC stack reached
   1150mAm(-2) when connected in a parallel configuration. The outcome of
   this work implies that suitably up-scaled MFC-aerobic integrated
   bioprocesses could be used for colour industry wastewater treatment
   under industrially relevant conditions with possible prospects of
   bioelectricity generation.

   Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. The factors affecting the dye
   removal efficiency including pH, ionic strength, stirring time, solution
   volume, and adsorbent weight were investigated using Taguchi fractional
   orthogonal array design (OA(16)). The results of adsorption kinetics at
   50 and 100 mg L-1 under optimum conditions (pH = 2, ionic strength = no
   salt addition, the solution volume = 25 mL, stirring time = 10 min and
   adsorbent weight = 0.15 g) showed that removal of RY 160 was performed
   through a pseudo-second-order kinetic model (q(e) = 30.2 mg g(-1), R-2 =
   1). Isotherm models at three contact times of 10, 25, and 50 min showed
   that adsorption follows the Freundlich model (n = 1.2, K-F = 2.3).
   Reusability experiments under optimum conditions confirmed the removal
   efficiency of more than 95% after 16 repetitive adsorption usage. The
   results of real samples showed that this nanocomposite is an effective
   adsorbent for the rapid removal of RY 160. Low-cost, reusability and
   fast elimination have made the synthesized nanocomposite as a useful
   adsorbent in RY 160 removal.

   development of environmentally friendly systems for the removal of
   pollutants from effluents. The use of green adsorbents from tree leaves
   is a key research domain in this regard. In this empirical review, plant
   leaves biosorption studies within the last two decades were considered.
   The numerous source plants, preparation and modification techniques and
   adsorbent improvement findings were elucidated. The basic steps of
   preparation were found to be similar for most studies and it involves
   pre-cleaning, drying, grinding and sieving. In some studies, further
   chemical modification was conducted. Comprehensive catalogues of
   empirical findings were presented for removal efficiency, adsorption
   capacity, factor optimal, equilibrium, kinetics and thermodynamic
   studies. In these areas, a variety of findings were deduced by
   researchers with the peculiarity of obtained results being consequent on
   the type and nature of the pollutant and plant precursor. The desorption
   methodology and reusability potential was also considered and key
   knowledge gaps elucidated. Real wastewater treatment, pilot and
   full-scale applications, column studies, disposal and treatment ways of
   the exhausted adsorbents are fallow areas needing more extensive
   exploration. It can be surmised that plant leaves are excellent,
   eco-friendly, cost-effective and easy-to-prepare precursors for the
   development of biosorbents effective in removing heavy metals, dyes,
   cations and other chemical species from aqueous solutions.

   was carried out for each process. It was observed that after the
   optimization of the processes, chemical oxygen demand (COD) removals
   greater than 88% were achieved. In addition, it was observed that the
   use of the LED lamp required lower reagent concentrations compared to
   solar and UV-A sources. A kinetic study was carried out under the best
   conditions obtained and it was observed that the sources showed rapid
   evolution, reaching a COD removal equilibrium with 30 min of reaction.
   Reagent monitoring was also carried out, and it was observed that they
   were not limiting to the reaction. Phytotoxicity analysis was also
   satisfactory since the treated effluents allowed a higher relative
   growth and germination index of the cucumber roots compared to the raw
   effluent. Finally, the cost analysis indicated that the use of LED lamps
   resulted in a reduction in electrical consumption compared to the UV-A
   lamp, as well as a reduction in the cost of reagents due to the lower
   concentration of reagents required compared to processes assisted by
   natural sunlight and UV-A.

AB Aiming to mitigate disposal and water pollution problems, biochars were
   prepared from cocoa pod husk (CPH) waste for application in artificial
   wastewater simulating real conditions of textile effluents. Therefore,
   the morphological properties of biochars obtained via one/two step NaOH
   activation were compared and characterized by XRD, Raman spectroscopy,
   FESEM/EDS and the BET technique. According to these results, biochar
   obtained from the one-step method (AQ(1)) was chemically characterized
   by Boehm titration as well as the point of zero charge and used for the
   removal of a mixture of brilliant green (BG), rhodamine B (RB) and
   methyl orange (MO) as artificial wastewater. To evaluate the remaining
   concentration of each dye after adsorption without previous separation,
   a derivative spectrophotometry method was applied because some overlap
   will occur. In order to overcome this problem, adequate wavelengths for
   each dye in the mixture were established: BG = 631, RB = 592 and MO =
   377 nm. Additionally, optimum conditions were determined such as pH 6
   and a dosage of 50 mg and the effect of the initial dye concentration
   was studied in the range of 5-20 mg L-1. The adsorption rate of the
   ternary dye mixture was fitted to the pseudo second-order model and the
   affinity of AQ(1) towards each dye was in the following order: BG > RB >
   MO. Furthermore, the adsorption isotherm data were described by
   multi-component Langmuir and Freundlich models. Finally, the presence of
   sodium chloride was explored and the synergetic effect in the removal of
   BG and MO was demonstrated, whereas the adsorption of RB was not
   promoted under the influence of this salt widely used in the textile
   industry.

AB The jeopardy of the synthetic dyes effluents on human health and the
   environment has swiftly aggravated, threatening human survival. Hence,
   sustained studies have figured out the most acceptable way to eliminate
   this poisonous contaminant. Thereby, our investigation aimed to
   fabricate montmorillonite/magnetic NiFe2O4@amine-functionalized chitosan
   (MMT-mAmCs) composite as a promising green adsorbent to remove the
   cationic methylene blue (MB) and crystal violet (CV) dyes from the
   wastewater in neutral conditions. Interestingly, MMT-mAmCs composite
   carries high negative charges at a wide pH range from 4 to 11 as
   clarified from zeta potential measurements, asserting its suitability to
   adsorb the cationic contaminants. In addition, the experimental study
   confirmed that the optimum pH to adsorb both MB and CV was pH 7,
   inferring the ability of MMT-mAmCs to adsorb both cationic dyes in
   simple process conditions. Furthermore, the ferromagnetic behavior of
   the MMT-mAmCs composite is additional merit to our adsorbent that
   provides facile, fast, and flawless separation. Notably, the
   as-fabricated composite revealed an auspicious adsorbability towards the
   adsorptive removal of MB and CV, since the maximum adsorption capacity
   of MB and CV were 137 and 118 mg/g, respectively. Moreover, the isotherm
   and kinetic investigatins depicted that the adsorption of both cationic
   dyes fitted Langmuir and Pseudo 2nd order models, respectively. Besides,
   the advanced adsorbent preserved satisfactory adsorption characteristics
   with maximal removal efficacy exceeding 87% after reuse for ten
   consecutive cycles. More importantly, MMT-mAmCs efficiently adsorbed MB
   and CV from real agricultural water, Nile river water and wastewater
   samples at the neutral pH medium, reflecting its potentiality to be a
   superb reusable candidate for adsorptive removal cationic pollutants
   from their aquatic media.

AB The biosorption ability of sugar-beet pulp was improved by modifying
   with quaternary ammonium-salt for examination of its potential
   application in decolorization process from wastewater. Decolorization
   conditions were investigated as functions of different experimental
   parameters such as initial pH, biosorbent amount, time and dye
   concentration. At the optimum pH (2.0) the biosorption reached to an
   equilibrium within relatively short time (30 min) and was followed by
   the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Langmuir isotherm better fitted
   the equilibrium data with the maximum monolayer biosorption capacity of
   98.32 mg g(-1). AR1 biosorption performance of quaternary ammonium-salt
   modified sugar-beet pulp (QAMSBP) was also investigated in the mix
   solutions containing RB49 and AY17 dyes at different concentrations (1,
   50 and 100 mg L-1) and the biosorption potential of QAMSBP did not
   change at 1 and 50 mg L-1 of other dyes. Obtained results demonstrated
   that AR1 biosorption onto QAMSBP could also be successfully applied to
   real wastewater in continuous system. IR analysis revealed the
   complexation is one of the important mechanisms involved in AR1
   biosorption. All the results indicated that QAMSBP was a potential
   biosorbent for toxic dye removal from wastewaters. (C) 2014 Elsevier

AB A magnetic metal-organic framework (MOF) composite,
   MIL-101(Fe)@PDopa@Fe3O4, was synthesized as the stable adsorbent for
   removal of methyl red (MR) and malachite green (MG) from wastewaters. A
   very thin film of 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (L-Dopa) was used as an
   efficient and environmentally friendly binder between Fe3O4 particles
   and MIL-101(Fe). Characterization of MIL-101(Fe)@PDopa@Fe3O4 was
   accomplished by various spectroscopic, microscopic and thermal analysis
   techniques. Magnetic properties of the composite were studied by
   vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). Influencing factors such as pH,
   ionic strength, contact time, adsorbent dosage, temperature, and initial
   dye concentration on the adsorption ability of the
   MIL-101(Fe)@PDopa@Fe3O4 were investigated. The very excellent adsorption
   capacities (833.33 and 1250 mg/g for MG and MR, respectively) were
   achieved. Adsorption kinetics, thermodynamics and isotherms studies
   indicated that MG and MR adsorption followed Langmuir isotherm model and
   pseudo second-order kinetic model. The Adsorbent was successfully used
   to remove industrial colors from real textile wastewater. The
   MIL-101(Fe)@PDopa@Fe3O4 was found to be recyclable for removal of MR and

AB The protection of water sources and wastewater treatment are important
   aspects for industrial development, human health, and sustainable
   societies. Elimination of textile dyes and other organic pollutants from
   industrial wastewater is urgent and imposes considerable improvements on
   the current methods. Adsorption is an efficient and low-cost method in
   which new eco-friendly adsorbents with high adsorption capacities are
   needed. For designing these adsorbents, some criteria such as large
   surface area and high porosity are frequently desired in the scientific
   studies published in the literature. In this work, a series of
   adsorbents were systematically prepared by thermal-acid treatments of a
   natural kaolinite to obtain solids with different surface areas (23, 36,
   351, and 594 m(2)/g) and porosities (microand mesopores). The solids
   were used to study the real influence of both high surface area and high
   porosity on the adsorption of a textile azo-dye (basic red 46) and its
   removal from water. Different dye concentrations, pH, and adsorbent
   quantities were also studied, and relatively high adsorption capacities
   (q(m)) were observed for the solids. The results showed that the
   adsorption of this dye is little sensitive to the surface area and
   porosity of the adsorbents, and it does not consistently respond to the
   increase of these parameters. The kinetic models (pseudo-second-order
   and intra-particle diffusion) suggest the adsorption of BR-46 on
   external surface without mass transport in internal pores. Classical
   isotherms (Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin) were applied, and
   Langmuir's model showed the best fit when a low adsorbate/adsorbent
   ratio was studied.

AB Dyes are one of themainwater pollutants andmany biological and
   environmental problems are associated with them. Rhodamine B (RhB) is
   one of the most commonly used dye in the textile, printing, paints, and
   paper industry. The present work reports the sorptive removal of
   Rhodamine B direct dye from wastewater onto developed cellulose and clay
   composites. Sorbent material cellulose (48 g) was extracted from 80 g of
   bagasse. Then cellulose and two types of acid-activated clays were used
   to make efficient sorbent namely, composite I and II. Various
   characterization techniques were used to study the physiochemical
   properties of the synthesized composites. Different sorption affecting
   parameters were optimized such as initial dye concentration, time,
   temperature, pH, and composite dose for the efficient sorption of RhB
   onto composites. Equilibrium time was 60 min for composite-I and 80 min
   for composite-II Non-linear equilibrium isotherm and kinetic models
   demonstrated the fitness of Pseudo-second order and Redlich-Peterson
   isotherm. Composite- I and II removed 85.9% and 95.6% of RhB at pH 2 in
   120 min, respectively. The sorption efficiency was checked, and sorbents
   were applied to real textile effluent which showed promising removal
   efficiency of over 90%. To confirm the experimental results,
   computational optimization and vibrational calculations were carried out
   using the Gaussian 09 program package with 3-21 G, 6-311 G, and 6-311+G
   basic sets. Geometric parameters showed the planar geometry. In the case
   of FTIR spectra, fundamental ring vibrations were observed with C-H and
   C-C. This study suggests that the developed composites have exceptional
   sorption ability to remove the dye contents from aqueous media. (C) 2020

AB Textile industry represents an important source of toxic substances
   rejected in environment. Indeed, effluent of these industries contains
   dyes and chemicals. They are rejected in environment without any
   treatment. The aim of this work is to evaluate ecotoxicological effect
   of industrial textile effluents on the sludge harvested from activated
   sludge treatment plant of Marrakech city (Morocco). For this, we are
   interested in determining the inhibition condition that corresponds to
   50% decrease of bacterial activity in sludge. Obtained results showed
   that inhibition percentage of bacterial activity depends narrowly on
   contact time and on added effluent volume, until a limit concentration
   where there is no degradation of substratum. In fact, substratum
   degradation speed shows about 65 times decrease when 80% (v/v) of
   textile wastewater is added, in comparison with the controlled one.
   Consequently the inhibition constant (Ki) that corresponds to 50% of
   bacterial inhibition activity is estimated to 0.65 mg l(-1) of dye.
   These studies confirm a real ecotoxicological risk of these effluents.
   Therefore, a treatment is mandatory before their rejection in
   environment. (C) 2018 Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. on behalf

AB Waste parts of the plant Sauropus androgynus (SA), an agricultural
   by-product, and its base-modified form (MSA) have shown potential for
   the removal of the cationic crystal violet (CV) dye from aqueous
   solution. The optimum contact time of SA and MSA was found to be 180 and
   120 min, respectively, and no changes in the pH of the system were
   necessary for optimum performance. SA performed well in moderate ionic
   environments; and MSA tolerated up to 1.0 M ionic strength. The
   adsorption process was exothermic. The Sips isotherm model is suitable
   to describe adsorption of CV on both SA and MSA giving adsorption
   capacities of 326.38 and 489.58 mg g(-1), respectively. Regeneration
   studies showed that acid and base washings of SA and MSA could
   regenerate the adsorbents and allowed them to be reused. Given the
   excellent adsorption capacities, stability at different pH and salt
   concentrations, ability to be regenerated and reused, both SA and MSA
   would be deemed suitable new, potential low-cost adsorbents to remove
   the CV dye in wastewater treatment. More importantly, MSA has
   demonstrated its superior characteristics to be used in real-life
   situation for removal of CV dye when present in high ionic environments.

AB The potential of continuous electrocoagulation (EC) process with
   aluminium electrodes for the post-treatment of upflow anaerobic sludge
   blanket (UASB) reactor-treated municipal wastewater was investigated. In
   order to optimise the performance, influence of three parameters
   affecting EC, namely, chemical oxygen demand (COD), current density (CD)
   and residence time in the reactor was studied using response surface
   methodology (RSM) with Box-Behnken design (BBD) employing real UASB
   reactor effluent. The results of the modelling study gave the following
   optimum conditions: influent COD concentration 274 mg/L, CD 2 mA/cm(2)
   and residence time 5 min; and predicted effluent COD, phosphate and
   turbidity values of 87 mg/L, 0.59 mg/L, and 12.6 NTU, respectively.
   Confirmatory tests at these optimum conditions gave 90 mg/L effluent
   COD, 0.57 mg/L effluent phosphate and 15.2 NTU effluent turbidity, which
   were in close agreement with the predicted results. At optimum
   conditions, high removals of BOD and suspended solids were also
   observed, with effluent BOD and suspended solids concentration of 34
   mg/L and 29 mg/L, respectively. High total coliform and faecal coliform
   removals of 99.81% and 99.86%, respectively, were also obtained at these
   conditions. The study thus suggests EC as an attractive post-treatment
   option for UASB reactor-treated municipal wastewater. (C) 2016

   aluminium salt as aluminium chlorohydrate (ACH) for the treatment of
   textile wastewater using coagulation/flocculation technology. Though,
   ACH belongs to the same group of polyaluminium salts, it is
   significantly different from polyaluminium chloride (PACl) in terms of
   the degree of hydration and alumina content and was used for the first
   time as a coagulant for the decolourisation of synthetic as well as real
   textile wastewater. The experimental results revealed that ACH is highly
   effective for the treatment of synthetic textile wastewater producing
   more than 99% of colour removal and 45% of COD reduction efficiency at a
   very low dosage of 200 mg L-1. The decolourisation of real textile
   wastewater was found to be very much in line with the results obtained
   for the treatment of synthetic textile wastewater. Superior
   decolourisation efficiency at a very low dosage as compared to that of
   the pre-established studies for real textile wastewater and least volume
   of easily dewatered sludge production makes ACH a novel and very
   promising coagulant for the treatment of industrial textile wastewater.

AB The present article reports an integrated treatment method viz
   biodegradation followed by photo assisted electrooxidation, as a new
   approach, for the abatement of textile wastewater. In the first stage of
   the integrated treatment scheme, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) of the
   real textile effluent was reduced by a biodegradation process using
   hydrogels of cellulose-degrading Bacillus cereus. The bio-treated
   effluent was then subjected to the second stage of the integrated scheme
   viz indirect electrooxidation (InDEO) as well as photo-assisted indirect
   electro oxidation (P-InDEO) process using Ti/IrO2-RuO2-TiO2 and Ti as
   electrodes and applying a current density of 20 mA cm(-2). The influence
   of cellulose in InDEO has been reported here, for the first time.
   UV-Visible light of 280-800 nm has been irradiated toward the
   anode/electrolyte interface in P-InDEO. The effectiveness of this
   combined treatment process in textile effluent degradation has been
   probed by chemical oxygen demand (COD) measurements and H-1 - nuclear
   magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). The obtained results indicate
   that the biological treatment allows obtaining a 93% of cellulose
   degradation and 47% of COD removal, increasing the efficiency of the
   subsequent InDEO by a 33%. In silica molecular docking analysis
   ascertained that cellulose fibers affect the InDEO process by
   interacting with the dyes that are responsible of the COD. On the other
   hand, P-InDEO resulted in both 95% of decolorization and 68% of COD
   removal, as a result of radical mediators. Free radicals generated
   during P-InDEO were characterized as oxychloride ((OCI)-O-center dot) by
   electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR). This form of coupled
   approach is especially suggested for the treatment of textile wastewater
   containing cellulose. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   treated textile finishing wastewater was investigated using powdered
   TiO2 and ZnO catalysts with UV-A lamp irradiation. Photodegradation and
   photodecolorization of the samples real textile industrial wastewater is
   observed directly proportional to pH and catalyst concentrations.
   Optimum catalyst concentration was found as 2 g l(-1) in both catalysts.
   COD removal in TiO2 assisted system was obtained two fold higher than
   ZnO assisted system depending characteristics of the wastewater samples.
   Optimum pH values were determined to be 5 and 9 for TiO2 and ZnO
   assisted systems respectively. A COD removal of 45% and 23% were
   obtained using and ZnO catalysts respectively during 3 h irradiation.
   The effluents of photocatalytic treated samples using both catalysts
   displayed no acute toxicity at the end of 3 h irradiation time at
   optimum experimental conditions. Results, in conclusion, revealed that
   both TiO2 and ZnO catalysts were found to be very effective in color
   removal and provided safe and proper effluents to meet discharge limits,
   even reuse guideline values.

AB A two-step treatment process has been investigated for effective textile
   effluent management. In step I, the effluent was decolorized via
   chlorine-mediated indirect electrooxidation (InDEO), while H2O2 was
   electrogenerated during step II in the decolorized textile effluent, by
   employing an H-type divided electrochemical cell. The native salts
   present within the decolorized textile effluent (9.4 g/L Na2SO4 and 0.8
   g/L NaCl) were exploited as electrolytes for the catholyte, whereas 0.5
   N sulfuric acid was used as the anolyte for the in situ electrochemical
   generation of H2O2. During the cyclic voltammetry tests, O-2 reduction
   at the activated carbon felt cathode was observed around -0.86V versus
   saturated calomel electrode (SCE) at a scan rate of 100 mV/s. Under
   optimized conditions (cathode potential of -0.9V vs. SCE and catholyte
   at pH 6) about 1.45 +/- 0.01 mM H2O2 have been generated. The effluent
   containing H2O2 was subjected to Fenton reaction and the generation of
   OH center dot radicals was confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance
   spectroscopy. The results indicated a 59% reduction of the chemical
   oxygen demand; significant modifications of the functional groups were
   observed by Fourier transform IR spectroscopy. High performance LC
   analysis confirmed the degradation of the organic compounds during the
   oxidative treatment process. These findings suggest the application of
   this method for degradation of highly colored textile effluents.

AB The photocatalytic degradation of acid orange II (AOII), which is a

   natural pomegranate as heterogeneous bioadsorbent in the presence of
   TiO2 activated by an external ultraviolet radiation under various
   conditions. Powder of pomegranate rind and leaves has been tested for
   heavy metals adsorption. A special attention has been paid to the
   treatment efficiency of a real dye effluent in the presence of heavy
   metal, namely zinc (Zn). The experimental results showed that for low
   values of Zn2+ in the solution (40 mg/L), AOII removal kinetics fastened
   until reaching an optimum, then slowed down for higher concentrations
   (100 mg/L). This behavior could be explained by the fact that at low
   zinc concentrations, Zn2+ could be incorporated in the photocatalytic
   process because of its photonic character. At high concentrations, zinc
   is more susceptible of consuming radicals due to competition effect. On
   the other hand, results showed that no photocatalytic activity of Zn2+
   was recorded. The degradation rate was strongly influenced by the
   presence of heavy metals, initial concentrations of AOII, and amount of
   crushed powder of pomegranate rind and leaves. Moreover, different ways
   of adding natural pomegranate in the photocatalytic reactor have been
   tested in order to keep Zn2+ concentration in optimal conditions.

   (FeCl3) at diverse ranges of pH (1-11) on the removal of chemical oxygen
   demand (COD), total suspended solids (TSS), colour, total nitrogen (TN)
   and turbidity from real textile wastewater. At pH 9, FeCl3 demonstrated
   the most effective removal for all studied contaminants. Experiments
   were conducted to assess the dosage and operating conditions to achieve
   optimum removal efficiency for all studied contaminants by using FeCl3.
   The obtained results demonstrated the higher ability of FeCl3 in textile
   wastewater treatment with optimum conditions; pH 9, 150 rpm in 1 min
   rapid mixing, 30 rpm in 20 min slow mixing and 30 min settling.
   Artificial neural network (ANN) model was applied to predict the removal
   efficiencies of the studied contaminants under different variables using
   FeCl3 coagulant. ANN model adequately predicted the studied parameters
   removal efficiencies with a coefficient of determination greater than
   90% and has the capability of simulating the coagulation process and

   electro-Fenton (EF) process using iron doped SBA-15 (Fe-SBA-15; SBA:
   Santa Barbara Amorphous) mesoporous silica as a heterogeneous catalyst.
   This catalyst was prepared with the help of ferric nitrate nonahydrate
   as a forerunner by wet impregnation method. Various techniques of
   characterization such as XRD and N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherms
   were performed to confirm the presence of iron particles in the pores of
   the catalyst. These characterization methods were also used to examine
   the morphological properties and textural arrangement of the synthesized
   material. In the batch study of EF process, 750 mL working volume of RhB
   dye was taken. Anode and cathode used in the process were graphite
   electrodes respectively with effective area of 25 cm(2) each. To
   maximise the process efficiency, the effect of initial pH, applied
   voltage, electrode spacing, the concentration of supporting electrolyte
   and Fe-SBA-15 dosage were investigated and optimized. The optimum
   conditions obtained were pH of 2, voltage of 8 V, an electrode spacing
   of 3 cm and Fe-SBA-15 dosage of 15 mg L-1. At the end of 3 h
   electrolysis, maximum RhB removal of 97.7% and TOC removal of 35.1% were
   achieved for 10 mg L-1 RhB concentration. In a batch study with real
   wastewater, 97% of color and 39% of TOC were removed at optimum
   conditions. Utilization of EF heterogeneous catalyst Fe-SBA-15 is an
   alternative technique for the elimination of dyes from solution. (C)

   (R-CR(2):0.999; R-RhB(2):0.999) model, indicating overall adsorption of
   RhB and CR through spontaneous and exothermic chemisorption on the

   was complex where nAg-TC, possessing the synergistic effects of TLB and
   nAg, showed surface complexation, electrostatic attraction, and
   H-bonding, leading to chemisorption. Study showed excellent reusability

AB The treatment of a real cashew-nut effluent has been studied using a
   pioneering sequential process involving electrocoagulation (EC) and
   electrochemical oxidation (EO) approaches. The performance of the system
   was analyzed in terms of chemical oxygen demand removal, by-products
   evolution, toxicity and energy consumption. Preliminary EC tests with Fe
   electrodes were performed at different current densities (8.33-100 mA
   cm(-2)), yielding COD removals among 17-51%. The residual iron
   concentration detected was below the Brazilian legal limits of
   discharge. The sludge obtained from the experiments at 8.33 and 100 mA
   cm(-2) revealed a heterogeneous morphology with interconnected laminar
   plates. Regarding their structure, the powders showed a mixture of
   poorly crystalline phases. The main elements identified were oxygen,
   carbon and iron, which allow proposing an alternative use of this powder
   for construction and building materials. Sequential experiments, using
   EC at 8.33 or 100 mA cm(-2) plus EO, intensified COD removals up to 51%
   and 80%, corresponding to 5 and 65 kWh m(-3) of energy consumption,
   respectively. To evaluate the by-products generated during EO treatment,
   the evolution of carboxylic acids and inorganic species (PO43-, NH4+,
   NO3-, NO2-) was followed. After that, phytotoxicity analyses were
   performed in order to assess water quality and its reuse in irrigation
   activities. Based on these results, the sequential experiment with EC by
   applying 8.33 mA cm(-2) plus EO (35.5 mA cm(-2)) was considered the most
   efficient and viable to depurate the real cashew-nut effluent.

AB Milk-processing industry effluent (MPIE) poses severe problems for
   aquatic and environmental systems, especially in the South Asian region.
   Therefore, its treatment is of great interest. This study deals with the
   investigation of chitosan titanium dioxide nanoadsorbent (CTiO2) coated
   onto sand particles via calcination that are used to remove the emerging
   pollutants. The adsorptive properties of these developed adsorbents are
   compared with those of the nascent sand without coating as well as with
   the chitosan titanium dioxide nanoadsorbent coated sand (CTiO2-CS).
   Batch adsorption experiments were performed to investigate the percent
   reduction efficiency (%RE) of organic pollutants in terms of biological
   oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) from synthetic and
   real effluents. The maximum %RE of BOD (96.76) and COD (98.91) was
   achieved at 1.5 M dose of CTiO2-CS, 120 min of contact time, pH 6.5, an
   initial BOD concentration of 900 mg/L, and an agitation speed of 400
   rpm. Similarly, the %RE of COD was found to be 86.75 for synthetic
   effluent and 90.97 for real effluent at initial COD concentrations of
   8000 mg/L. Pseudo-second-order and Langmuir models are found to be the
   best fits for BOD and COD adsorption. The diffusion model suggests that
   surface adsorption as well as intraparticle diffusion contribute to the
   actual adsorption process. Regeneration experiments were performed for
   four cycles, and CTiO2-CS was found to be the most regenerable adsorbent
   material. The performance of the adsorbent was compared with previous
   studies, and it was found to have excellent adsorption capacity. As a
   result, the developed filter bed could be used as a promising
   superadsorbent for the removal of organic load in MPIE.

   Eichhornia crassipes is an option as raw material in the contribution of
   cellulose due to its enormous presence in contaminated wetlands, rivers,
   and lakes. The efficiency in the removal of heavy metals is due to the
   cation exchange between the hydroxyl groups and carboxyl groups present
   in the biomass of E. crassipes with heavy metals. Through different
   chemical and physical transformations of the biomass of E. crassipesThe
   objective of this review article is to provide a discussion on the
   different mechanisms of adsorption of the biomass of E. crassipes to
   retain heavy metals and dyes. In addition to estimating equilibrium,

   this biomass through equilibrium models with isotherms, in order to
   design one biofilter for treatment systems on a larger scale represented

AB Complete degradation of azo dye Orange G was studied using a 500 mL
   continuous flow reactor made of SUS 316 stainless steel. In this system,
   a titanium reactor wall acted as a cathode and a titanium plate-type
   electrode was used as an anode in a subcritical reaction medium. This
   hydrothermal electrolysis process provides an environmentally friendly
   route that does not use any organic solvents or catalysts to remove
   organic pollutants from wastewater. Reactions were carried out from 30
   to 90 min residence times at a pressure of 7 MPa, and at different
   temperatures of 180-250 degrees C by applying various direct currents
   ranging from 0.5 to 1 A. Removal of dye from the product solution and
   conversion of TOC increased with increasing current value. Moreover, the
   effect of salt addition on degradation of Orange G and TOC conversion
   was investigated, because in real textile wastewater, many salts are
   also included together with dye. Addition of Na(2)CO(3) resulted in a
   massive degradation of the dye itself and complete mineralization of
   TOC, while NaCl and Na(2)SO(4) obstructed the removal of Orange G.
   Greater than 99% of Orange G was successfully removed from the product
   solution with a 98% TOC conversion. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB As textile wastewater is a major source of surface water pollutants when
   not sufficiently treated prior to discharge, strict disposal regulations
   were set and monitored by environmental authorities. As such, continuous
   research is necessary in textile wastewater remediation. In this study,
   real textile wastewater samples were directly collected from the
   wastewater discharge point of a manufacturer in Prai, Malaysia. Various
   particle sizes of clinoptilolite were applied to treat the wastewater in
   a series of batch experiments at a predetermined dosage, pH, and contact
   time. Removal of three main parameters [i.e. color, suspended solids
   (SS), and chemical oxygen demand (COD)] was monitored. The removal rates
   of color, SS, and COD were 47.9, 48, and 37.4%, respectively, at
   particle sizes larger than 2mm and then increased to 91, 96, and 62%,
   respectively, at particle sizes of 75-250m. The highest COD removal of
   70% was also achieved at particle sizes smaller than 75m. These findings
   indicate that 75-250m is the optimal size range of clinoptilolite for
   simultaneous removal of the three parameters under the same experimental
   conditions. After wastewater treatment, the residual concentration of SS
   was 10mg/L, which is within the standard limit of 50mg/L effluent
   discharge.

AB The adsorption of acid red 97 dye (RED 97) by the waste of the
   filamentous fungus Beauveria bassiana was analyzed. The adsorbent was
   obtained as a waste of a fermentative process, and characterized by
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray powder diffractometry (XRD), and specific
   surface area (BET). After the characterization, adsorption tests were
   carried out to determine the ideal conditions of pH, adsorbent mass, and
   contact time for the process. Adsorption isotherms, thermodynamic
   studies, and the treatment of textile effluent were also investigated.
   The adsorbent characterization allowed the visualization of its
   amorphous structure, with irregular and heterogeneous particles. The
   pore diameter was 51.9 nm and the surface area was 0.247 m(2) g(-1). 1.2
   g L-1 of the adsorbent and pH of 2.0 were the ideal conditions for RED
   97 adsorption. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model was the most
   appropriate to represent the experimental data, being the equilibrium
   reached in about 110 min. The Langmuir model was the most suitable to
   represent the equilibriumdata, with maximumadsorption capacity of 194.1
   mg g(-1) at 45 degrees C. The adsorption processes was thermodynamically
   spontaneous, favorable, and exothermic. In the treatment of a real
   textile effluent, 5 g L-1 of the spores was capable to decolorize 70% of
   the solution. Therefore, spore wastes of Beauveria bassiana were
   promising for RED 97 adsorption.

AB A natural biosorbent obtained from Pyracantha coccinea was modified with
   an anionic surfactant to facilitate its dye removal ability. Modified
   biosorbent was successfully employed for the decolorization of Methyl
   Violet (MV)-contaminated solutions. A three-variable Box-Behnken design
   for response surface methodology was used to examine the function of
   independent operating variables. Optimum pH and biosorbent amount were
   found to be 6.0 and 0.055 g, respectively. The effects of temperature
   and ionic strength on the dye removal performance of biosorbent were
   also investigated. A biosorption equilibrium was attained within 30 min
   and experimental data fitted well to the pseudo-second-order model. The
   Langmuir isotherm model fitted adequately to the equilibrium data. The
   maximum monolayer biosorption capacity of the modified biosorbent was
   found to be 254.88 mg g(-1). Good biosorption yields were also recorded
   in continuous biosorption system. Ion exchange and complexation could be
   suggested as possible mechanisms for the biosorption. The developed
   modified biosorbent was regenerated up to 80.30% by 0.005 M HCl. At real
   wastewater conditions, it has 86.23 +/- 0.21 and 94.51 +/- 1.09% dye
   removal yields in batch and column systems, respectively. Modified
   biomaterial can be used as an effective biosorbent for the removal of MV
   dye from aqueous solution with high biosorption performance.

AB The presence of reactive dyes in textile wastewater is a serious
   environmental concern due to their associated mutagenic and carcinogenic
   effects. The present study aims to analyze the effect of different
   anodic materials on the decolorization of a real textile wastewater
   effluent. For this purpose, four different anodic materials-TiO2-coated
   platine, TiO2-coated ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) (viz., RuO2), titanium
   dioxide (TiO2), and graphite-were connected, respectively, to titanium
   dioxide (TiO2) used as a cathode electrode. Color and cost optimization
   studies were performed using the response surface methodology and the
   Box-Behnken experimental design (BBD). According to ANOVA results, the
   R2 values for Pt/TiO2, RuO2/TiO2, TiO2/TiO2, and graphite/TiO2 electrode
   pairs were found to be 97.4%, 93.8%, 92.44%, and 92.2%, respectively,
   indicating a good compatibility as it is close to one. The results show
   that color removal efficiencies at the optimal conditions were 86.3%,
   90.8%, 91.5%, and 93.6% for Pt/TiO2, graphite/TiO2, TiO2/TiO2, and
   RuO2/TiO2, respectively. Furthermore, energy consumption cost at the
   optimum conditions was also evaluated, and the results were as follows:
   Pt/TiO2 (0.95 euro/m3), graphite/TiO2 (0.74 euro/m3), TiO2/TiO2 (0.31
   euro/m3), and RuO2/TiO2 (0.26 euro/m3). Consequently, this research
   paper shows that all of the tested anodic materials give satisfactory
   color removal efficiencies higher than 86%. When energy consumption and
   color removal are considered together, the use of TiO2/TiO2 and
   RuO2/TiO2 pairs would be preferred. Practitioner Points Anodic
   contribution was investigated for decolorization of textile wastewater
   by electrooxidation process. Graphite, TiO2-coated Pt, TiO2-coated RuO2,
   and TiO2 were used as anode materials. Highest color removal with lowest
   energy consumption was achieved with TiO2-coated RuO2 anode material
   (93.6%).

AB This research presents a simple and versatile procedure
   (diazonium-induced grafting) for in situ surface functionalization of
   Polyethersulfone (PES) membrane through covalent attachment of aniline
   oligomers. The process involves gradual reduction of oligomer diazonium
   salts which yields a superhydrophilic layer of branched aniline
   oligomers (BAO) grafted on the membrane surface. With this procedure,
   the PES nanofiltration membrane, alter facilely from hydrophobicity to
   superhydrophilicity. The structural characteristic, nanofiltration
   performance, antifouling behavior and chemical, mechanical and long-term
   permeation stability of prepared membranes were evaluated. The modified
   membrane showed great performance with high water flux (93.6 L/m(2) h
   bar), high flux recovery ratio 99% and after fouling with powdered milk
   protein for 90 min. The novel BAOPES modified membrane had long-term
   structural stability in an acidic and basic environment that it's a
   critical property for real operation in industry. Its application in
   algal dye removal was also assessed using a real algal wastewater from a
   working stabilization pond in a cross-flow filtration system for a 62-h
   period. The modified membrane showed a smooth behavior in flux with only
   11.45% reduction after 62 h, indicating outstanding stable permeability
   and anti-fouling function provided by the applied modification. This
   modification demonstrates great potential for convenient practical
   application.

AB Synthetic dyes from effluents and wastewaters can be harmful to the
   ecosystem even at low concentrations. This study evaluated the
   performance of biosorbent from Terminalia catappa (TC) shells to remove
   methylene blue (MB) from aqueous solutions. The biosorbent was
   characterized using SEMEDX, FTIR, BET, XRF and TGA. The optimum
   condition for TC shell uptake of MB was at pH 5, 45 min contact time,
   initial concentration of 800 mg L-1 and with a maximum biosorption
   capacity was 88.62 mg g(-1). The optimal conditions were achieved at the
   particle size (<= 36 mu m), 25 mL dye solution containing 0.1 g
   biosorbent dosage and 100 rpm agitation speed. The adsorption isotherm
   and kinetics study revealed that MB uptake was best-fit to the
   Freundlich and pseudo-second-order models respectively. The
   thermodynamic analysis determined over the temperature range of 298-318
   K showed that the process was endothermic and spontaneous. The mechanism
   of MB uptake onto TC shells was by pore diffusion, hydrogen bonds,
   cation exchange, electrostatic attraction and pi-pi stacking. MB was
   effectively desorbed from TC shells using 30% acetic acid and usable for
   3 cycles. The MB removal of efficiency was 90.56% in real wastewater
   sample at pH 5. (c) 2021 The Korean Society of Industrial and

AB Nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) particles were investigated for the
   removal of methylene blue (MB) from aqueous solutions and the treatment
   of textile industry effluents. The nZVI material was characterized by
   XRD, TEM, EDS, FTIR, and SEM. It was demonstrated that several
   functional groups such as C-H, C = C, C-C, and C-O contributed to MB
   reduction. At initial MB concentration of 70 mg/L, the optimum pH was 6,
   achieving a removal efficiency of 72.1% using an nZVI dosage of 10 g/L,
   stirring rate of 150 rpm, and temperature of 30 degrees C within 30 min.
   The adsorption isotherm was described by the Langmuir model with
   monolayer coverage of 5.53 mg/g, and the Freundlich equation with
   multilayer adsorption capacity of 1.59 (mg/g).(L/mg)(1/n). The removal
   mechanisms of MB included reduction into colorless leuco-MB,
   precipitation as Fe(II)-MB, adsorption as ZVI-MB or FeOOH-MB, and/or
   degradation using center dot OH radicals. The synthesized nZVI particles
   were applied to reduce various organic and inorganic compounds, as well
   as heavy metal ions from real textile wastewater samples. The removal
   efficiencies of COD, BOD, TN, TP, Cu2+, Zn2+, and Pb2+ reached up to
   91.9%, 87.5%, 65.2%, 78.1%, 100.0%, 29.6%, and 99.0%, respectively. The
   treatment cost of 1 m(3) of textile wastewater was estimated as 1.66

AB The conditions for the adsorption of the dye Acid Orange 8 onto carbon
   were optimized using the Taguchi method. Four samples of activated
   carbon were obtained from guava seeds, and their textures were
   characterized by nitrogen adsorption isotherms. The equilibrium
   adsorption isotherm on mesoporous carbon (114 m(2) g(-1)) showed
   multilayer adsorption behavior with a kinetic curve that could be
   described by the Ho equation. To achieve maximum dye removal, the
   effects of temperature (10-40 degrees C), specific surface area (67-143
   m(2) g(-1)), initial concentration (250-1500 mg L-1), pH (2-13), and the
   mass-volume ratio (10-150 g L-1) were studied using an L-16 orthogonal
   array. The percent dye removal was transformed into an accurate S/N
   ratio for a "high is better" response. pH was found to be the most
   effective factor for promoting dye removal, followed by the mass-volume
   ratio. A temperature of 10 degrees C. a specific surface area of 114
   m(2) g(-1), an initial concentration of 500 mg L-1, pH 2, and a
   mass/volume ratio of 150 g L-1 were the best conditions determined by
   the Taguchi method. Finally, the carbon was tested using samples of real
   and simulated wastewater solutions under the optimal conditions, and
   color removal efficiencies of 60% and 40%, respectively, were obtained.

AB The present study aimed towards the utilization of hybrid approaches for
   the effective treatment of real pharmaceutical industry wastewater. The
   focus was to treat pharmaceutical wastewater with low (LSW) and high
   organic strength (HSW), which was collected from the effluent treatment
   plant of the representative bulk pharmaceutical manufacturing unit. The
   hybrid approach included coagulation treatment, biological treatment and
   gamma irradiation which were employed individually and in sequence to
   determine the most appropriate treatment sequence for effective
   remediation of real pharmaceutical wastewater. To compare process
   performance, gamma-irradiation was employed as pre-treatment and
   post-treatment stage to biological treatment. To achieve the enhanced
   removal efficiency using gamma irradiation treatment, oxidant like H2O2
   and persulfate ions S2O82- were used and optimized for LSW and HSW.
   Results indicated that use of H2O2 lead to enhanced COD and TOC removal
   efficiency when compared to S2O82-. The sequential approach of
   coagulation, gamma irradiation and biological treatment accounts for the
   synergistic degradation and detoxification of recalcitrant
   pharmaceutical wastewaters, and lead to overall 92.7% +/- 2.3% and 90.2%
   +/- 2.9% of COD removal of LSW and HSW, respectively. The pre-treatment

   by supported photocatalyst based heterogeneous photocatalytic reaction.
   TiO2 based supported photocatalyst was prepared by the hydrothermal
   technique to improve the photocatalytic performance along with easy
   recovery of suspended photocatalyst from aqueous medium after
   photoreaction. TO2 deposited calcium alumino-silicate beads (CASB)
   supports were prepared under mild hydrothermal conditions
   (Temparature-200 degrees C, Duration-24 h). In the present study,
   industrial dyes such as Amaranth and Brilliant Yellow were used as model
   micro-pollutants in aqueous solution. A real time pesticide industrial.
   effluent was tested for its photocatalytic removal of organic pollutants
   using TO2 deposited CASB supported photocatalytic composite as an
   effective photocatalyst. Photocatalytic degradation of micro-pollutants
   present in aqueous medium was carried out in a batch photoreactor, at
   atmospheric pressure and temperature (28 degrees C). The influence of
   different light sources, irradiation time, catalyst load and catalytic
   performance is discussed. The photocatalytic degradation of
   micro-pollutants in aqueous medium was evaluated by determination of COD
   and %T. Easy separation and recovery of suspended photocatalysts from
   aqueous solution is the major advantage of hydrothermally prepared
   supported photocatalytic composite.

AB This study investigates the possibility of applying an adsorption
   process using two abundant natural minerals M1 and M2. Without
   pretreatment or activation, the adsorbents were used to treat real
   textile wastewater samples (collected from Fez city, Morocco). As a
   cost-effective alternative, these materials were characterized by
   different analyses, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and
   X-ray fluorescence (XRF). Chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biological
   oxygen demand (BOD) were used to characterize the textile wastewater.
   Additionally, the influence of operating conditions (contact time,
   adsorbent dosages, and pH) was evaluated. Results show that the
   adsorption process takes place quickly, reaching the equilibrium at 90
   and 160 min for M1 (88% COD) and M2 (79% COD). Both materials show a
   higher affinity to Cr (39%) and lower affinity to Cu (28%). A
   pseudo-second-order kinetic model provides the best fit to the
   experimental adsorption data. Germination tests indicate a low toxicity
   after the adsorption process. Performance of both materials was compared
   with that of other literature studies.

AB Huge quantities of different dyes are generated by various industries
   such as cosmetic, leather, printing and textile and food. This study
   aimed to generate and apply tire-derived activated carbon magnetised
   with the Fe3O4 nanoparticles (MAC) for the removal of reactive blue 19
   (RB19) dye from aquatic solutions. FE-SEM, VSM, XRD, FTIR and BET
   analyses were used to determine MAC properties. Under optimal conditions
   of pH 3, the initial concentration of dye 100 mg/L, the composite dose 1
   g/L and the reaction time of 45 min, the removal efficiency for RB19 was
   93.22%. Isotherm findings illustrated that RB19 adsorption onto the MAC
   followed the Langmuir model. Moreover, the absorption kinetics is well
   interpreted by the pseudo-second-order model in low scrutinised
   concentrations. The S-BET and total pure volume for the MAC were 421.11
   m(2) g(-1) and 0.467 cm(3) g(-1). Under the optimum conditions, maximum
   adsorption capacity of the MAC in Langmuir model enhanced to the amount
   of 119.05 mg/g. Also, the reusability (with NaOH) of the MAC revealed
   about 21% decreases in the removal efficiency within five consecutive
   runs. It is concluded that the application of the magnetised activated
   carbon due to its high efficiency in removing RB19 from laboratory and
   actual samples can be evaluated in future studies to be utilised in real
   scales.

AB The removal efficiencies of electrocoagulation (EC) systems are highly
   dependent on the initial value of pH. If an EC system has an acidic
   influent, the pH of the effluent increases during the treatment process;
   conversely, if such a system has an alkaline influent, the pH of the
   effluent decreases during the treatment process. Thus, changes in the pH
   of the wastewater affect the efficiency of the EC process. In this
   study, we investigated the dynamic effects of pH. To evaluate approaches
   for preventing increases in the pH of the system, the MATLAB/Simulink
   program was used to develop and evaluate an online computer-based system
   for pH control. The aim of this work was to study
   Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control and fuzzy control of the
   pH of a real textile wastewater purification process using EC. The
   performances and dynamic behaviors of these two control systems were
   evaluated based on determinations of COD, colour, and turbidity removal
   efficiencies.

   for various wastewater treatment applications as individual cases like
   cadmium (Cd) removal, methylene blue (MB) dye degradation, and treatment
   of real textile and dyeing industry effluent. These NMs are used as
   adsorbents and photocatalysts in an indegenously developed end-to-end
   treatment process and a photocatalytic reactor for treatment of textile
   wastewater. The used NMs are suitably filtered and recovered for reuse;
   however, still this work focusses on the extent of potential risk and
   environmental safety of these engineered NMs towards seed germination
   and plant growth, in the event they escape wastewater treatment plants
   and reach out to natural water bodies and soil systems, accumulate over
   a period of time, and comes in contact with plant species. For
   synthesis, sol-gel method was utilized; cetyltrimethylammonium bromide
   (CTAB) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) were used as cationic and
   anionic surfactants, respectively, to act as particle growth templates
   and improve surface morphology. Detailed characterization involved XRD
   (X-ray diffraction), FTIR (Fourier-transform Infrared Spectroscopy), SEM
   (Scanning Electron Microscopy), TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy),
   EDX (Energy Dispersive X-ray analysis), and BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller)
   surface area analysis. Improved morphology and surface properties, from
   irregular shape in Bare TiO2 to spherical shape in surfactant-modified
   titania, led to enhanced Cd removal and MB dye degradation efficiency.
   Bare TiO2 was used for complete treatment of textile wastewater, which
   took 5 h in achieving water quality, which is safe for discharge and
   reuse as per norms of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Govt. of
   India. Phytotoxicity studies of these NMs at a wide concentration range
   (0-1000 mg L-1) were undertaken towards Vigna radiata, and 500 mg L-1
   concentration was found to be optimally safe for seed germination and
   plant growth.

AB In this paper, beta-cyclodextrin-glycine-modified TiO2 nanoparticles
   (TiO2/Gly/beta-CD NPs) as a nano-adsorbent were prepared and employed
   for the removal of some organic pollutants from aqueous solutions.
   Results from FT-IR, FESEM, TEM, XRD, EDX and BET surface area
   measurement showed that the TiO2 NPs was modified with Gly and beta
   eta-cyclodextrin (8 CD). The effect of environmental factors, including
   pH, contact time, adsorbent dosage, temperature, and initial dye
   concentration on the adsorption ability of the TiO2/Gly/beta-CD were
   investigated in detail. The results of this study showed that
   TiO2/Gly/beta-CD has high adsorption efficiency toward organic dyes, and
   were comparable with other adsorbents. The adsorption capacities of MB,
   MO, AB113, and DR1 onto TiO2/Gly/beta-CD NPs are found to be 81.97 mg/g,
   384.62 mg/g, 76.92 mg/g, and 138.89 mg/g, respectively. In addition, the
   adsorbent presented can be used in several adsorption-desorption cycles.
   The dye adsorption kinetics, thermodynamics and isotherms were also
   investigated. The results indicated that pseudo-second-order kinetic
   model with correlation coefficients greater than 0.9971, and Freundlich
   isotherm model with correlation coefficients greater than 0.991 well
   describe the adsorption of MB, MO, AB113, and DR1 on the
   TiO2/Gly/beta-CD NPs. Moreover, the thermodynamic parameters indicated
   that the adsorption process for all types of organic dyes was
   exothermic. Additionally, the adsorbent was successfully applied to
   remove industrial dyes from real textile wastewater with satisfactory
   results. (C) 2017 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by

   reaction. The prepared MCB was used to remove amaranth dye in solution.
   The syn-thesized MCB was characterized to define its surface morphology
   and specific elements. The amaranth dye adsorption system was optimized
   by varying the contact time, pH, and initial concentration. The
   adsorption of MCB on amaranth dye was measured in a wide pH range.
   According to Zeta potential, the surface of MCB was positively charged
   in the acidic pH region, which was more conducive to the adsorption of
   anionic amaranth dye. In addition, the adsorption data was fitted with
   the pseudo-first-order model and Langmuir adsorption model and the
   maximum adsorption capacity reached 404.18 mg/g. The adsorption
   efficiency of MCB was still above 95% after three cycles of adsorption
   and desorption. The removal percentage in the real sample of amaranth
   dye by MCB was within 94.5-98.6% and the RSD was within 0.14-1.08%. The
   MCB adsorbent with advantages of being easy to prepare, easy to separate
   from solution after adsorption, has good adsorption performance for
   amaranth dye and is effective potential adsorbent to remove organic
   anionic dye in wastewater.

AB Acoustic cavitation and the physical effects of ultrasound have gained
   recently much attention as promising techniques for the degradation of
   recalcitrant organics in water such as dye. This article primarily
   focuses on the removal of Indigo dye substances from real textile
   wastewater samples using standalone ultrasonication and advanced
   oxidation-assisted ultrasonication. The ultrasonic treatment was
   optimized using a central composite design (CCD) (29 experiments, 4
   factors) as a response surface methodology. Various design experimental
   factors (frequency, pH, initial concentration, and temperature) were
   investigated. The design response considered was the COD removal after 2
   h of sonication. The optimal values of frequency, pH, initial
   concentration, and temperature were 578 kHz, 2, 1000 mg/L, and 35
   degrees C respectively. At the aforementioned optimal factors, the US
   showed ultimate COD and decolorization efficiency of 16% and 59%,
   respectively. To get more details, a kinetic model for the rate of COD
   removal using non-linear regression analysis was developed and the
   validity of the model was tested. The rate of COD removal followed
   pseudo-first-order kinetics for the sonicated textile wastewater.
   Moreover, the dye degradation intermediate products were identified by
   GC-MS analysis. The results showed that both Indigotine and Indigo
   carmine were broken down into smaller chemical compounds. Finally, the
   decolorization efficiency of dyes using oxidation-assisted US (H2O2 and
   Fenton process) and using physicochemical treatment
   (coagulation/flocculation) was measured. A maximum decolorization
   efficiency of 94% was achieved in the sample treated by Sono-Fenton
   using 15 mM ferrous sulfate.

   environment-friendly hybrid hydrogel is prepared by a simple mixing of
   selenocarrageenan (SeCA) and graphene oxide (GO) under heating and
   stirring for 5 min without any other reagent. Such a selenocarrageenan
   hybrid graphene hydrogel (SeCA-GH) without volume shrinkage exhibits
   excellent adsorption capacity and selective binding to dyes and Hg2+.
   The maximum adsorption capacity of methylene blue and Hg2+ on SeCA-GH is
   168 mg g(-1) and 331 mg.g(-1) at 25 degrees C, respectively.
   Furthermore, the adsorption characteristics of SeCA-GH are investigated
   in detail, including saturated adsorption capacity, adsorption isotherm,
   and kinetic adsorption process. Notably, SeCA-GH can be easily
   regenerated and reused for multiple cycles without release of SeCA and
   GO. SeCA-GH as recyclable adsorbent offers a promising candidate for

AB In this study, UV/chlorine was used for the degradation of a food dye
   (Brilliant Blue FCF, BBF). The effect of pH, chlorine dosage and
   reaction time was studied on BBF degradation. More than 95 % of BBF was
   eliminated during 30 min reaction time at optimized conditions of pH = 3
   and chlorine dosage = 0.6 mM. The scavenging assay showed that hydroxyl
   radicals had the highest contribution (66.9 %) while chlorine radicals
   (17 %) and dichlorine radicals (10.4 %) had minor role in degradation of
   the dye. Pseudo-first order model was well fitted for UV/chlorine
   process with the rate constant of 0.088 min(-1). The effect of sulfate,
   chloride, nitrate and bicarbonate anions were studied in a way that
   bicarbonate ions showed high inhibitory effect on BBF degradation. The
   presence of iron and copper enhanced the degradation rate of BBF in
   UV/chlorine process. The application of solar irradiation instead of UV
   lamp was also tested. The results exhibited that solar irradiation can
   be considered for decolorization of BBF especially in the presence of
   transition metals. Mineralization of different processes were
   considered, the highest value obtained was around 37 % for UV/chlorine.
   The UV/chlorine was performed on a real wastewater. UV/chlorine process
   showed a high efficient process in terms of decolorization while the
   removal of organic compounds and detoxification (acute toxicity) was
   relatively poor. Finally, EE/O was calculated for BBF and COD removals
   from synthetic solution and real wastewater respectively.

   achieved equilibrium quickly, and the removal efficiencies were
   minimally affected by initial pH. The maximum uptake quantities of CR
   and Cr(VI) on LDH-EDTA-AM were 632.9 and 48.47 mg/g, respectively. In
   mixed systems, chromate removal was stimulated by the presence of CR,
   while the adsorption efficiency of CR was almost not influenced by
   coexisting Cr (VI). The mechanisms involved electrostatic attraction,
   surface complexation, and anion exchange for the adsorption of both
   hazardous pollutants. In the Cr(VI) adsorption process, reduction also
   took place. The removal efficiencies in real contaminated water were all
   higher than those in the laboratory solutions.

AB Due to high pollution load and colour contributing substances, pulp and
   paper mill effluents cause serious aquatic and soil pollution. A
   lignin-degrading bacterial strain capable of decolourising Azure-B dye
   was identified as lignin peroxidase (LiP) producing strain LD-5. The
   strain was isolated from pulp and paper mill effluent contaminated site.
   Biochemical and 16S rDNA gene sequence analysis suggested that strain
   LD-5 belonged to the Serratia liquefaciens. The strain LD-5 effectively
   reduced pollution parameters (colour 72%, lignin 58%, COD 85% and phenol
   95%) of real effluent after 144h of treatment at 30 degrees C, pH 7.6
   and 120 rpm. Extracellular LiP produced by S. liquefaciens during
   effluent decolourisation was purified to homogeneity using ammonium
   sulfate (AMS) precipitation and DEAE cellulose column chromatography.
   The molecular weight of the purified lignin peroxidase was estimated to
   be similar to 28 kDa. Optimum pH and temperature for purified lignin
   peroxidase activity were determined as pH 6.0 and 40 degrees C,
   respectively. Detoxified effluent was evaluated for residual toxicity by
   alkaline single cell (comet) gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assay using
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae MTCC 36 as model organism. The toxicity
   reduction to treated effluent was 49.4%. These findings suggest
   significant potential of S. liquefaciens for bioremediation of pulp and
   paper mill effluent. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Today, the treatment of dye wastewater discharged by various industries,
   such as textiles, has attracted the attention of many researchers due to
   the non-biodegradability nature of dye contaminants. Methylene blue is
   one of numerous dyes existing in this wastewater that causes a variety
   of human health problems. Because of the low efficiency of biological
   treatment processes in the removal of this range of contaminants,
   physicochemical technologies such as adsorption and advanced oxidation
   processes have been studied as efficient alternatives. Among them,
   advanced oxidation processes can provide almost complete removal of
   these contaminants with the least requirement to manage final products.
   In these processes, the objective is the production of reactive radicals
   (such as center dot OH and) which are suitable for rapid and
   non-selective reactions with organic contaminants. So, in this study,
   decolorization and mineralization of methylene blue in aqueous solutions
   were investigated by the persulfate/Fe2+ process. For this purpose, the
   effect of different parameters such as pH, per-oxydisulfate/Fe2+ ratio,
   peroxydisulfate concentration, and initial methylene blue concentration
   were evaluated. In addition, predominant radicals and mineralization of
   methylene blue were studied. Finally, the contribution of each
   sub-process and degradation of methylene blue in real wastewater were
   investigated. In the first step of this study, the effect of initial pH
   on methylene blue removal by persulfate/Fe2+ process, it was observed
   that with increasing pH from 3 to 9, the removal efficiency of 50 mg/L
   of methylene blue was decreased from 84.4 to 69.7%. In the second step,
   obtained results showed that with increasing peroxydisulfate/Fe2+ ratio
   from 2 to 16, methylene blue removal efficiency was decreased to 18%.
   The supplementary experiments for determination of predominant radicals
   using tert-butanol and methanol revealed that sulfate radical was
   predominant in the applied process. Although complete decolorization of
   methylene blue was attained at 20 min, when the time lasted to 40 min,
   96% mineralization of methylene blue was observed by
   peroxydisulfate/Fe2+ process. Finally, the studied process showed
   efficient removal of methylene blue dye from aqueous solution and real
   wastewater containing a high concentration of methylene blue.

AB The present study represents the application of a hybrid process to a
   pretreated real textile wastewater. Hybrid process includes
   electrocoagulation, adsorption, and photo Fenton- like oxidation
   methods. In our previous study, electrocoagulation (EC) method was
   investigated and the optimum conditions were determined. Nearly 35%
   total organic carbon (TOC), 18.6%, chemical oxygen demand (COD), 90%
   turbidity, and 50% color removal efficiencies were achieved by the EC
   step. In this study adsorption and photo Fenton- like oxidation were
   applied sequentially to the effluent of EC step. Walnutshell and corncob
   agricultural wastes were used for the preparation of the activated
   carbon. After adsorption step, the removal efficiency of the TOC was
   found to be nearly 75% and color, turbidity, and total dissolved solids
   achieved the standards for irrigation water. Also, the removal
   efficiency of the COD was found as 27%. For adsorption, Langmuir
   isotherm model fit better and the second order kinetic model was found
   to be the best model. The BiNiO3 catalyst with corncob support material
   was effective for the photo Fenton- like oxidation method. The optimum
   conditions were selected as 0.75 g/L BiNiO3/corncob based catalyst
   loading and pH = 7-7.5. At the end of the hybrid process, 87% TOC, 49%
   COD, 96% turbidity, approximately 90% color and 95-97% suspended solids
   removals were achieved. The hybrid system was effective to achieve the
   irrigation water standards except for salinity and COD. Agricultural
   wastes used in preparation of catalysts and adsorbents were promoted to
   be innovative, environmentally friendly and economical.

AB Organic dyes derivatives are well characterized as carcinogenic, toxic
   and hazardous materials. The presence of low concentration levels of
   dyes in water (ppm or even ppb) may cause severe changes in the physical
   appearance of water. Therefore, removal of dyes from water represents a
   great challenge of finding the most efficient methodology. For this
   reason, zirconium silicate nanoparticles [ZrSiO4 NPs] were used to
   assemble a new nanomaterial based on surface modification with SDS to
   produce [ZrSiO4 NPs -SDS] as an efficient nanocomposite for removal of
   two cationic dyestuffs; viz. crystal violet (CV) and methylene blue (MB)
   from water. The SEM, TGA, XRD, FT-IR, HR-TEM and surface area analyses
   are used to elucidate the surface morphology of ZrSiO4-SDS
   nanocomposite. Various adjustable parameters such as pH, nanocomposite
   mass, contact time, interfering salts and reaction temperature were also
   studied. The optimum value of pH was recorded to be 2 and 10 for CV,
   while at pH 1 and 10 for MB dyes. The observed removal values were
   recorded as 94.8, 96.8 and 97.9% at pH 2 and 95.8, 96.5 and 97.5% at pH
   10 for CV using 20, 30 and 40 mg L-1, respectively. Different adsorption
   isotherms and kinetic models were applied and the best fitting was with
   the pseudo-second order kinetic model. The thermodynamic parameters
   revealed that the reactions were spontaneous and exothermic. Finally,
   5.0 mg of the nanocomposite was applied for adsorptive removal of CV and
   MB from real water specimens, with percentage recoveries in the range
   85.2-96.14% and 83.31-94.26%, respectively.

AB Herein, the preparation of activated carbon from waste vinasse by using
   hydrothermal H2O2 oxidation combined with a two-step pyrolysis process
   has been described for the first time as a new utilization approach for
   the waste vinasse. The characterization studies were performed by TGA,
   FT-IR, Raman spectroscopy, SEM-EDX and gas adsorption measurements. The
   approach generated a microporous activated carbon with high specific
   surface area ( 989 m(2)/g) from waste vinasse. After simple experiments
   on various dye solutions, adsorption performance of the activated carbon
   was specifically studied on the methylene blue solution as functions of
   solution pH, contact time, adsorbent amount and reusability. The
   obtained activated carbon had a higher Langmuir adsorption capacity
   towards methylene blue ( 909.091 +/- 31.900 mg/g) than many other
   adsorbents and it is reusable for at least six cycles. The adsorption
   performance of the obtained activated carbon was also evaluated using
   both simulated and real dyehouse effluents. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Different interpenetrating polymeric networks (IPN) based on sodium
   alginate, carrageenan and bentonite were developed to remove heavy
   metals and dyes from contaminated water. Four significant preparation
   factors; crosslinking time, calcium chloride concentration, alginate to
   carrageenan mass ratio,and bentonite to carrageenan mass ratio were
   studied and optimized via full factorial design and response surface
   methodology to determine the optimum composition with highest adsorption
   capacity. Different optimal conditions and combinations were found
   depending on the type of heavy metal or dye to be removed. Low calcium
   chloride concentration was a common factor in all cases of heavy metals
   and dyes removal which indicates the negative effect of excessive
   crosslinking on the removal percentage. The adsorption capacity of
   methylene blue, Fe3+, Ni2+, and Cr3+ ions is 1271, 1550, 1500 and 1540
   mg/g adsorbent, respectively. Reusability tests confirmed that the
   optimized formulations can be reused five successive times without
   significant drop in their removal efficiency. Upon utilization of the
   optimized formulations on real contaminated waters from tannery plant
   and oasis groundwater, they demonstrated an excellent performance as
   they removed above 95% of the original heavy metals contaminants and 40%
   of the acidic dye content. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Textile dyeing wastewater is characterized by low biodegradability and
   high nitrogen strength, which is difficult to meet the increasingly
   stringent discharge requirements. Therefore, the tertiary nutrient and
   refractory organics removal is considered and aerated biofilter is often
   adopted. However, the aerobic condition and carbon source shortage
   restrict tertiary biological nitrogen removal. In this study, iron scrap
   was introduced as the filter medium to enhance the pollutant removal
   capacity, and three aerobic biofilters were constructed. Biofilter Fe-CE
   was filled with iron scrap and ceramisite; biofilter Fe-AC was added
   with iron scrap and granular activated carbon, and biofilter CE only had
   ceramisite to pad as control system. After the biofilters were
   acclimatized by synthetic wastewater and actual dyeing wastewater, the
   optimal operation parameters based on nitrogen removal were determined
   as pH 7, gas water ratio 5:1, hydraulic retention time 8 h and C/N ratio
   8.5:1. The iron scraps improved total nitrogen (TN) removal
   significantly, with TN removal efficiency of 68.7% and 57.3% in
   biofilter Fe-AC and biofilter Fe-CE, comparing with biofilter CE of
   29.9%. Additionally, phosphorus and COD had better removal performance
   as well when iron scrap existed. Further investigation interpreted the
   reason for iron's facilitating effect on tertiary nutrient and
   refractory organics removal. The introduction of iron scrap made the
   habitat conditions such as pH values, DO concentrations and biomass
   contents inside the biofilters change towards the direction beneficial
   for pollutant elimination especially for nitrogen removal. In iron
   containing biofilters, the majority of nitrogen, phosphorus and organic
   pollutants were removed in the iron scrap layers, and more pollutants
   types appeared, implying that iron triggered pollutants to go through
   more diverse degradation or transformation pathways. Moreover, the
   phylum Proteoabcteria dominated in samples of ceramisite-containing
   biofilters, with abundances more than 40%. The iron scrap existence
   increased the abundances of phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, and
   triggered higher abundance of denitrification bacteria. (C) 2018

AB Electrocatalytic degradation of micropollutants is an attractive
   strategy for advanced wastewater management, but the development and
   optimization of innovative anodic materials are needed. This study
   investigated newly designed metal-TiO2 nanopowder composite coated Ti
   mesh anodes for enhanced degradation of 1,4-dioxane (10 mg/L spiked) and
   dyes present in real industrial wastewater effluents. Based on
   multi-component mixture coating tests, a metal-TiO2 composite for the
   most efficient electrocatalytic degradation of 1,4-dioxane was attained
   in the binary molar composition range of Ru:Ti = 0.6:0.4-0.9:0.1.
   Interestingly, Ir addition (i.e., ternary metal oxide composite) always
   had an antagonistic impact on the electrocatalytic performance. The
   binary metal oxide composite structure was X-rayed and identified as
   comprising RuO2-TiO2 crystals. Substantive removal of 1,4-dioxane and
   color was achieved with a small coating amount, but thicker coating had
   no or negative effects. This is possibly because the production of the
   oxidants responsible for organics degradation (reactive chlorine species
   and hydrogen peroxide) decreases with excessive coating layers. A
   properly coated binary RuO2-TiO2 composite Ti mesh anode was as
   effective (or more so) than the boron-doped diamond electrode in terms
   of 1,4-dioxane degradation and decolorization of real textile
   wastewater.

AB The anode configuration determined the performance of power generation
   and contaminant removal in microbial fuel cell (MFC). In this study,
   double anodes were constructed along an up-flow MFC for mitigating the
   suppression of refractory organic azo dye Reactive Brilliant Red X-3B
   and increasing the power output. Results revealed that high
   concentration of X-3B suppressed the power generation of MFC. The
   maximum power density decreased from 0.413 to 0.161 W/m(3), and the
   inner resistance rose from 448 to 698 omega. However, double anodes
   weakened the suppression of X-3B to the current generation. Compared
   with single anode, the attenuation of MFC current decreased from 48 to
   40%. Meanwhile, the X-3B removal efficiency in double-anode MFC was
   19.81% higher compared with a single-anode condition when the X-3B was
   1000 mg/L. The degradation pathway analysis indicated that aromatic
   amines formation and further oxidation were achieved sequentially in the
   MFC. Furthermore, microbial communities in the lower and upper anodes
   were analyzed, revealing that the microorganisms in the lower anode were
   more inclined to degrade the pollutant, whereas those in the upper anode
   were more inclined to generate electricity. This double-anode structure
   showed the potential for large concentration range of azo dye removal
   and the current recovery in real textile wastewater.

   the degradation of cationic (methylene blue, rhodamine B and crystal
   violet) and anionic (congo red, methyl orange and acid red 27) dyes
   using H(2)O(2)as an oxidising reagent. The methodology was optimised by
   using methylene blue and acid red 27 as representatives of cationic and
   anionic dyes, respectively. The optimisation process involved the study
   of the following critical parameters: concentration of dye and
   H(2)O(2)and sample flow rate for achieving complete and instantaneous
   degradation of dye. Using the experimental conditions established during
   optimisation, at a concentration of H2O2(0.03% (v/v) dye concentration
   of 50 mu g mL(-1)and a sample flow rate of 6 mL min(-1), it was possible
   for complete degradation (>99%) of dye compounds. TOC and COD values of
   treated samples were decreased to about 79% and 91%, respectively after
   second UV-photolysis/H(2)O(2)treatment indicating the considerable
   degradation of dyes was occurred during UV-photolysis process. In
   addition, studies on the effect of various ions Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+,
   Fe3+, Cl-, NO3-, SO42-, PO(4)(3-)and CO(3)(2-)that are normally present
   in dye effluents were carried out and the results indicated that these
   ions had no significant effect on the degradation efficiency of dyes.
   The developed procedure was finally applied to real textile wastewater
   which was degraded very effectively (>99%) indicating that the developed
   UV-photolysis setup has high potential for commercial scale
   applications.

   intraparticles diffusion models. The adsorption isotherms of MB onto
   ASAC are determined and correlated with common isotherm equations. The
   smaller RMSE value obtained for the Langmuir model indicates the better
   curve-fitting and the monolayer adsorption capacity of MB is found to be
   46.03 mg/g at 25 degrees C and 88.50 mg/g at 70 degrees C and pH 10. The
   evaluation of thermodynamics parameters such as the negative free energy
   Delta G degrees (+2.70025 to -1.76666 kJ/mol) and positive enthalpy
   change Delta H degrees (28.87613 kJ/mol) indicated a spontaneous and
   endothermic nature of the reaction with chemisorption process. This
   study in tiny batch gave rise to encouraging results, and we wish to
   achieve the adsorption tests in column mode under the real conditions
   applicable to the treatment of industrial effluents. The present
   investigation showed that ASAC is potentially a useful adsorbent for the
   heavy metals and dyes.

AB The study of adsorbent behaviour in laboratory conditions helps to
   predict the adsorption process in a large industrial scale. In this
   study, orange and lemon peels-derived activated carbon (OLPAC) was
   successfully synthesized and activated using phosphoric acid.
   Characterization was performed on the OLPAC and the material was used
   for the removal of methyl orange (MO) and methylene (MB) dyes from
   wastewater. The results of the scanning electron microscope and N2
   adsorption/desorption examination affirmed that the prepared
   nanocomposite is permeable, which is an advantage for the efficient
   removal of contaminants. Optimal conditions for the batch removal
   process were investigated using a one-factor time approach in different
   conditions of adsorption (Dye concentration 50-200 mg L-1, pH 2-10,
   adsorbent mass 0.010-0.8, and contact time 5-180 min. The adsorption
   isotherm equilibrium data were examined by Langmuir, Freundlich, and
   Temkin, isotherm model. As shown by the correlation coefficient (R2),
   the data were best described by Langmuir isotherms with maximum
   adsorption capacities of 33 and 38 mg g1 for methyl orange and methylene
   blue, respectively. Adsorption kinetic data were described using the
   pseudo-second-order model which suggests that adsorption of MO and MB
   was by chemisorption mechanism. The method was applicable to real
   wastewater samples, with satisfactory removal percentages of OM and MB
   (96 and 98 %). The results of this study show that OLPAC is an
   inexpensive biosorbent that is successfully utilized in removing methyl
   orange and methylene blue dyes from wastewater.

   on crude Tunisian clay to treat a real textile effluent. The clay
   characterization shows that the used clay is a rich-smectite clay. The
   response surface methodology (RSM) technique based on Box-Behnken design
   (BBD) was used to optimize the process. At optimum conditions which are
   initial pH solution of 8.24, effluent flow rate of 0.5 L.min(-)(1),
   voltage of 70 V, and added suspension of clay flow rate of 100
   ml.min(-1) the achieved color, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total
   suspended solid (TSS) removal efficiencies were respectively 96.87%,
   89.77% and 84.46% with 0.75USD.m(-)(3) as total cost. The additional
   laboratory experiments at optimum conditions agree with the predicted
   results, which confirm the accuracy and the capability of RSM to predict
   results in the defined space. Finally the designed process could be a
   good eco-friendly alternative to treat and reuse wastewater in

AB Sono-assisted adsorptive elimination of dyes from industrial effluent is
   proved to be a fast, efficient and clean technique. Highly pure
   nanozeolite X (nFAZX) was synthesized from waste coal post-combustion
   fly ash (CFA) by pre-fusion hydrothermal method. Rapid sono-assisted
   adsorptive elimination of methylene blue (MB) dye from water solution
   was studied in presence nFAZX, CFA and commercial zeolite X (CZX).
   As-synthesized nFAZX, raw CFA, and CZX have been characterized by means
   of X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier transform
   infrared (FUR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), field emission
   Scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET)
   adsorption/desorption isotherms for surface area analysis. The influence
   of adsorption variables, for example solution pH (3-11), adsorbent dose
   (0.05-0.25 g/100 ml), sonication time (2.50-12.50 min), and initial dye
   concentration (12.50-62.50 mg/L), on the % elimination of MB was
   explored by response surface methodology (RSM). Maximum MB removal
   (64.52% by CFA, 99.30% by nFAZX, and 96.57% by CZX) was obtained at pH
   8.25, 0.164g/100 ml of adsorbent, 9.92 min sonication time, and 25 mg/L
   MB concentration. The adsorption isotherms and kinetic models were best
   fitted with Langmuir isotherm and pseudo 2nd order model respectively
   for all three adsorbents. Also, the maximum Langmuir adsorption capacity
   of CFA, nFAZX and CZX for MB were 78.22 mg/g, 345.36 mg/g, and 250.41
   mg/g respectively for 0.160 g/100 ml adsorbents. The experimentation
   demonstrated a route of development of a cheap, eco-friendly sorbent
   nFAZX as well as a green, rapid and highly efficient protocol of
   treating synthetic dyes which are often present in real textile
   wastewater. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the present study, a novel treatment method based on the combination
   of ultrasonic and ultraviolet irradiation as well as various additives
   i.e. oxidants and catalysts has been developed for the treatment of real
   industrial wastewater containing copper phthalocyanine pigment. The
   progress of the treatment of wastewater has been monitored in terms of
   reduction in the chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic content
   (TOC) and total dissolved salts (TDS) content. Initially, the effect of
   operating conditions as ultrasonic power, temperature and pH on the
   extent of COD reduction has been studied. The optimized conditions
   established were 100 W as the ultrasound power, pH of 2, temperature of
   31 +/- 2 degrees C and reaction time of 120 min. Under these optimized
   conditions, the combination with photocatalytic oxidation (involving CuO
   and TiO2) with or without various additives like H2O2 and ozone has been
   studied. The efficacy of combined approaches was generally higher than
   individual treatment methods of sonolysis (51.52% as the COD reduction)
   and photolysis (45.65% as the COD reduction). The actual extent of COD
   reduction obtained for combined approaches of US/UV/CuO, US/UV/TiO2,
   US/UV/CuO/O-3 and US/UV/TiO2/O-3 was 78.5%, 85.5%, 91.67% and 94.44%
   respectively in 120 min of treatment. Sonophotocatalysis (catalyst as
   TiO2) combined with ozone established as the most efficient hybrid
   technique for COD reduction also resulted in maximum TOC removal of
   89.17% and TDS removal of 75.74%. Overall, the combination of US + UV +
   TiO2 + O-3 has been established as the most efficient technique for the
   treatment of phthalocyanine pigment based industrial wastewater,
   yielding final effluent conforming to discharge standards.

   fluorescein removal from water. The non pretreated solid phase did not
   display any sorption properties for the chosen dye. However, interesting
   sorption properties were observed following a chemical derivative
   treatment with nitric acid. The study was carried out using both batch
   and column approaches. Regarding the batch study, all parameters that
   influence sorption capacity, such, as pH, adsorbent mass, ionic
   strength, temperature and contact time, were evaluated. A sorptive
   capacity of 36.80 mg g(-1) was obtained in the optimized condition. In
   the fixed column bed study, the influence of particle size, flow rate
   and initial concentration of the dye were evaluated through breakthrough
   curves and a sorptive capacity of 4.35 mg g(-1) was obtained.
   Thermodynamic studies revealed that the adsorption is exothermic and
   spontaneous. Four different models, Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin and
   Redlich-Patterson, were employed. The Akaike information criterion (AIC)
   was employed to rank the best equilibrium model, which was determined as
   the Freundlich isotherm. The method was applied to a real sample and the
   same removal rate was obtained, thus indicating its suitability to
   wastewater treatment.

AB The sulfonated azo dye Reactive Orange 16 is the commonly used
   representative of reactive dyes, but is hard to be degraded by some
   conventional treatment methods. In order to develop more efficient and
   more cost-effective treatment methods for degrading this recalcitrant
   dye, the capability of the white-rot fungus Ganoderma sp. En3 isolated
   by our laboratory to decolorize and detoxify Reactive Orange 16 was
   investigated in this study. Ganoderma sp. En3 had a strong ability to
   decolorize high concentrations of Reactive Orange 16 and simulated
   textile wastewater containing Reactive Orange 16 in submerged cultures.
   Decolorization of Reactive Orange 16 and its simulated dye effluents by
   this fungus resulted in the decrease of phytotoxicity. Ganoderma sp. En3
   had strong adaptability and tolerance to high concentrations of Reactive
   Orange 16. Compared with some previous research, Ganoderma sp. En3 was
   superior to some other fungal strains reported previously in the rate
   and extent of decolorizing Reactive Orange 16. It was also found that
   the real textile wastewater could be efficiently decolorized by
   Ganoderma sp. En3 in submerged cultures. The crude enzyme produced by
   Ganoderma sp. En3 could also efficiently decolorize Reactive Orange 16
   and simulated textile wastewater under in vitro conditions. (C) 2013

   abatement of COD and absorbance (i.e. color) from real textile
   wastewater using a packed bed electrochemical reactor in a unique
   design, not previously encountered in the literature for the treatment
   of textile wastewater by electrocoagulation. The cylindrical iron
   reactor was used as a cathode while the packed bed formed from wrapped
   iron wire netting was used as an anode. Various operating parameters,
   such as current density, initial pH, wastewater recirculation flow rate
   and continuous flow regime, were examined for intensifying the
   performance of the process. Also, calculation of electrical energy
   consumption and the characterization of sludge formed during
   electrocoagulation have been performed. The initial COD concentration of
   1953 mg/L was reduced to 61 mg/L with a removal efficiency of 96.88%,
   while the color of the wastewater was almost completely removed. The
   experimental results, throughout the present study, have indicate that
   electrocoagulation of textile wastewater using a uniquely designed
   reactor was very effective and direct dischargeable effluent, complying
   with legal requirements, was obtained. The XRD analysis of the sludge
   produced during EC reveals that maghemite (Fe2O3) is the main by-product
   formed after EC. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study concerns the preparation of novel adsorbent prepared from
   calcium alginate bead modified with polyethyleneimine (PEI-CaAlg). The
   adsorption capacity of the PEI-CaAlg was examined by Remazol Brilliant
   Blue R (RBBR) and phosphate adsorption. PEI-CaAlg showed high removal
   efficiencies for RBBR (90.48%) and phosphate (88.10%). The removal of
   both RBBR and phosphate onto the PEI-CaAlg followed the Freundlich
   isotherm and the second-order model. The adsorption was studied in terms
   of thermodynamic and found to be feasible and spontaneous in nature. The
   reusability of the modified alginate beads was also examined up to five
   cycles. The removal efficiency was 90.48% at the first cycle and
   decreased to 75.15% at the end of the fourth cycle. The adsorption of
   color and phosphate from real textile wastewater was also instigated.
   The removal efficiencies for color and phosphate ions reached 80.24% and
   90.00%, respectively. Therefore, the prepared PEI-CaAlg can be
   considered as a novel, eco-friendly, and cost-effective adsorbent for
   simultaneous dye and phosphate adsorption. Practitioner Points This
   study aims to modify the surface of calcium alginate beads with
   polyethyleneimine (PEI). The adsorption of RBBR and phosphate by the
   modified alginate beads (PEI-CaAlg) was investigated. PEI is an organic
   polymer with a linear/branch shape, which can increase the active sites
   on the adsorbent surface. PEI has one nitrogen atom in every three atoms
   provides a positive charge that can complex with the negatively charged
   molecules. The adsorption of RBBR and phosphate were carried out onto
   PEI-CaAlg.

AB Breadnut skin, in both its unmodified (KS) and base-modified (BM-KS)
   forms, was investigated for its potential use as a low-cost adsorbent
   for the removal of toxic dye, malachite green (MG). Characterization of
   the adsorbents was carried out using scanning electron microscope, X-ray
   fluorescence and Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy. Batch
   adsorption experiments, carried out under optimized conditions, for the
   adsorption of MG were fitted using five isotherm models (Langmuir,
   Freundlich, Dubinin-Radushkevich, Temkin and Sips) and six error
   functions to determine the best-fit model. The adsorption capacity was
   greatly enhanced when breadnut skin was chemically modified with NaOH,
   leading to an adsorption capacity of 353.0mgg(-1), that was far superior
   to most reported adsorbents for the removal of MG. Thermodynamics
   studies indicated that the adsorption of MG was spontaneous on KS and
   BM-KS, and the reactions were endothermic and exothermic, respectively.
   Kinetics studies showed that both followed the pseudo-second order.
   Regeneration experiments on BM-KS indicated that its adsorption capacity
   was still maintained at>90% even after five cycles. It can be concluded
   that NaOH-modified breadfruit skin has great potential to be utilized in
   real-life application as a low-cost adsorbent for the removal of MG in
   wastewater treatment.

   peak developed in the range of 7 -40 Hz, suggesting the dominance of
   surface processes that are not explained by the classic stern-layer
   polarization theory. The recorded imaginary conductivity values were
   used as a proxy for adsorbed dye concentration in the calibration
   process of a reactive transport model. The model confirmed that SIP can
   successfully be used for real -time monitoring of the dye progression
   through the filter. The applicability of SIP as an effective monitoring
   tool was also shown for cyclic operation (adsorption-desorption cycles).

AB Real effluent of washing machine is one of the major sources of
   microplastics and fabrics in municipal and surface water. The effluents
   constitute large volume of wastewater with different surfactants since
   every household and industries nowadays use washing machine rather than
   traditional hand washing.
   In this work, a real effluent of washing machine was treated by
   electrooxidation (EO) in a pre-pilot plant scale electrochemical flow
   reactor using active (Ti/Pt) or non-active (boron doped diamond (BDD))
   anodes and Ti cathode. The effect of anode material (Ti/Pt or BDD) and
   the applied current density (16.6, 33.3 and 66.6 mA cm(-2)) on the decay
   of the organic matter, in terms of chemical oxygen demand (COD) during
   the electrochemical treatment was examined using the as-received
   effluent or by adding Na2SO4 as supporting electrolyte (as auxiliary in
   the conductivity). A decreased in organic matter (COD) was always
   observed when an increase on the applied current density was achieved at
   both anodes; however, BDD anode showed a well-defined trend as well as
   higher removal efficiency at all current densities studied when compared
   to Ti/Pt. Besides, faster and higher COD decay was attained by adding
   Na2SO4 to the real effluent compared to as-received effluent regardless
   of anode material used. Active chlorine species were also
   electrochemically produced at both anodes from the Cl- ions in the real
   effluent, contributing to the elimination of the pollutants. The
   mineralization of organic matter in the effluent was also determined,
   obtaining > 90% of total organic carbon (TOC) reduction after 360 min
   with BDD anode at 33.3 and 66.6 mA cm(-2). Based on the achieved
   results, EO is an efficient and effective treatment approach for the
   remediation of organic micropollutants in washing machine effluent
   especially with BDD anode.

AB Nowadays, the water ecosystem is being polluted due to the rapid
   industrialization and massive use of antibiotics, fertilizers,
   cosmetics, paints, and other chemicals. Chemical oxidation is one of the
   most applied processes to degrade contaminants in water. However,
   chemicals are often unable to completely mineralize the pollutants.
   Enhanced pollutant degradation can be achieved by Fenton reaction and
   related processes. As a consequence, Fenton reactions have received
   great attention in the treatment of domestic and industrial wastewater
   effluents. Currently, homogeneous and heterogeneous Fenton processes are
   being investigated intensively and optimized for applications, either
   alone or in a combination of other processes. This review presents
   fundamental chemistry involved in various kinds of homogeneous Fenton
   reactions, which include classical Fenton, electro-Fenton, photo-Fenton,
   electro-Fenton, sono-electro-Fenton, and solar photoelectron-Fenton. In
   the homogeneous Fenton reaction process, the molar ratio of iron(II) and
   hydrogen peroxide, and the pH usually determine the effectiveness of
   removing target pollutants and subsequently their mineralization,
   monitored by a decrease in levels of total organic carbon or chemical
   oxygen demand. We present catalysts used in heterogeneous Fenton or
   Fenton-like reactions, such as H2O2-Fe3+(solid)/nano-zero-valent
   iron/immobilized iron and electro-Fenton-pyrite. Surface properties of
   heterogeneous catalysts generally control the efficiency to degrade
   pollutants. Examples of Fenton reactions are demonstrated to degrade and
   mineralize a wide range of water pollutants in real industrial
   wastewaters, such as dyes and phenols. Removal of various antibiotics by
   homogeneous and heterogeneous Fenton reactions is exemplified.

AB There are more than a hundred textile industries in Turkey that
   discharge large quantities of dye-rich wastewater, resulting in water
   pollution. Such effluents must be treated to meet discharge limits
   imposed by the Water Framework Directive in Turkey. Industrial treatment
   facilities must be required to monitor operations, keep them
   cost-effective, prevent operational faults, discharge-limit
   infringements, and water pollution. This paper proposes the treatment of
   actual textile wastewater by vertical flow constructed wetland (VFCW)
   systems operation and monitoring effluent wastewater quality using fuzzy
   logic with a graphical user interface. The treatment performance of VFCW
   is investigated in terms of chemical oxygen demand and ammonium nitrogen
   (NH4-N) content, color, and pH parameters during a 75-day period of
   operation. A computer program was developed with a fuzzy logic system (a
   decision- making tool) to graphically present (via a status analysis
   chart) the quality of treated textile effluent in relation to the
   Turkish Water Pollution Control Regulation. Fuzzy logic is used in the
   evaluation of data obtained from the VFCW systems and for notification
   of critical states exceeding the discharge limits. This creates a
   warning chart that reports any errors encountered in a reactor during
   the collection of any sample to the concerned party.

AB Dye waste is one of the most serious types of pollution in natural water
   bodies, since its presence can be easily detected by the naked eye, and
   it is not easily biodegradable. In this study, zinc oxide nanoparticles
   (ZnO-NPs) were generated using a chemical reduction approach involving
   the zinc nitrate procedure. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), and UV-vis
   techniques were used to analyse the surface of ZnO-NPs. The results
   indicate the creation of ZnO-NPs with a surface area of 95.83 m(2) g(-1)
   and a pore volume of 0.058 cm(3) g(-1), as well as an average pore size
   of 1.22 nm. In addition, the ZnO-NPs were used as an adsorbent for the
   removal of Ismate violet 2R (IV2R) dye from aqueous solutions under
   various conditions (dye concentration, pH, contact time, temperature,
   and adsorbent dosage) using a batch adsorption technique. Furthermore,
   FTIR and SEM examinations performed before and after the adsorption
   process indicated that the surface functionalisation and shape of the
   ZnO-NP nanocomposites changed significantly. A batch adsorption analysis
   was used to examine the extent to which operating parameters, the
   equilibrium isotherm, adsorption kinetics, and thermodynamics affected
   the results. The results of the batch technique revealed that the best
   results were obtained in the treatment with 0.04 g of ZnO-NP
   nanoparticles at 30 degrees C and pH 2 with an initial dye concentration
   of 10 mg L-1, which removed 91.5% and 65.6% of dye from synthetic and
   textile industry effluents, respectively. Additionally, six adsorption
   isotherm models were investigated by mathematical modelling and were
   validated for the adsorption process, and error function equations were
   applied to the isotherm model results in order to find the best-fit
   isotherm model. Likewise, the pseudo-second-order kinetic model fit
   well. A thermodynamic study revealed that IV2R adsorption on ZnO-NPs is
   a spontaneous, endothermic, and feasible sorption process. Finally, the
   synthesised nanocomposites prove to be excellent candidates for IV2R
   removal from water and real wastewater systems.

AB The main objective of this research was to observe and evaluate the
   chemical properties of photocatalytic treated textile industrial
   wastewater to evaluate reusing it again for different purposes such as
   agricultural irrigation, recreational uses, groundwater recharge,
   industrial reuse, environmental uses, non-potable urban uses, indirect
   potable reuse and direct potable reuse. Photocatalytic treatments
   carried out over a suspension of titanium dioxide (anatase or rutile) or
   zinc oxide under artificial irradiation. The progress of treatment
   stages was followed by using different techniques of analysis. The
   chemical parameters include total hardness (ppm), total alkalinity
   (ppm), chemical oxygen demand, biochemical oxygen demand, total organic
   carbon (%) and acidity (pH). The concentration of major anions, such as,
   chloride (ppm), phosphate (ppm), nitrite (ppm), nitrate (ppm) were
   determined. The concentration of positive ions, such as, sodium (ppm),
   potassium (ppm), zinc (ppm), iron (ppm), cadmium (ppm), copper (ppm),
   nickel (ppm), cobalt (ppm) and manganese (ppm) and were also measured.
   Significance improvements of all these chemical parameters for all types
   of treated industrial wastewater were observed. Experimental results
   throughout the present study have indicated that the total hardness of
   real and simulated textile wastewater were reduced by more than 70 %
   after photocatalytic treatments with titanium dioxide and zinc oxide.
   Alkalinity, which represents the existence of calcium carbonate or
   magnesium carbonate, is often related to hardness. Results of alkalinity
   concentration in different types of textile industrial wastewater dyes
   used in this study were in the range 37.54-76.66 ppm. The percentage of
   reduction of alkalinity was ranged between 10-22 % for the treated
   textile industrial wastewater dyes with the different types of catalysts
   used in this study. The BOD5/COD ratio of treated real wastewater
   reached 0.691, 0.688 and 0.711 as compared to 0.398 of the raw
   wastewater when anatase, rutile and zinc oxide used as photocatalyst
   respectively. Although the decolorization efficiency reaches 100 %, the
   total organic carbon removal efficiency did not reach that percentage.
   The results demonstrated 72-87 % of TOC removal after 10 h of
   irradiation using titanium dioxide (anatase or rutile) and 92 % when
   zinc oxide was used for the different textile industrial wastewater
   dyes. The initial pH of simulated and real textile industrial wastewater
   was in the range 8.41-12.90. All pH values for the photocatalytic
   treated textile industrial wastewater dyes with anatase; rutile and zinc
   oxide were reduced to 7.00 +/- 0.20. Major anions e.g., chloride,
   phosphate, nitrite and nitrate were measured after and before
   photocatalytic treatments. The percentage of removal for these anions
   was exceeded 90 % and in many cases reached 100 %. However, no
   significant changes were observed in the concentrations of the major
   cations, sodium and potassium, after and before photocatalytic
   treatments for the five textile industrial wastewater dyes used in this
   article. Real and simulated textile industrial wastewater dyes were also
   analyzed for zinc, iron, cadmium, copper, nickel, cobalt and manganese
   using atomic absorption spectrophotometer. No changes were observed in
   the concentrations of these metals after and before photocatalytic
   treatments. The heterogeneous photocatalytic degradation of real and
   another four prepared simulated textile industrial wastewater dyes viz.
   , (Vat yellow, Reactive black, Reactive blue and Cowboy dyes) were
   carried out on a laboratory scale using three commercial photocatalysts
   namely, anatase, rutile and zinc oxide. Comparison between the
   efficiency of the three photocatalysts indicated that their efficiency
   fell in the sequence: ZnO > TiO2 (anatase) > TiO2 (rutile). However, the
   amount of zinc oxide required to reach the optimum activity is two times
   more than that for titanium dioxide (anatase or rutile) and the sequence
   was changed when the same concentration of mass was used (175 mg L-1).
   The sequence in such case as follows: TiO2 (anatase) > ZnO > TiO2
   (rutile). Generally, the results of this study suggest that the treated
   wastewater is suitable for domestic, industrial and irrigational
   purposes.

AB The development of an efficient sustainable catalyst for effective
   removal of hazardous chemicals, viz. nitrophenols and organic dyes, from
   wastewater is a challenging task. Herein, facile synthesis of Ag/NiO
   composites by anchoring Ag nanoparticles (NPs) on NiO octahedrons with
   different amounts of Ag NPs (AN-5% (5% Ag), AN-10% (10% Ag) and AN-15%
   (15% Ag)) has been demonstrated. SEM (scanning electron microscopic) and
   TEM (transmission electron spectroscopic) images ensured the proper
   anchoring of spherical Ag NPs (particle size = 16.54 +/- 1.88 nm) on
   octahedron particles of NiO, which was also ensured by XPS (X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy) analysis. Moreover, the resulting composites
   have an average surface area (49-52 m(2)g(-1)) and pore size (2.39-2.26
   nm). All three synthesized Ag/NiO composites (100 mu L) catalyzed the
   complete reduction of para-np (4-nitrophenol: 0.1587 mM) within 2-3 mM
   in the presence of 0.04 M NaBH4. Among them, AN-5% has been chosen
   because of the lowest anchored Ag (5%) to obtain the optimized
   catalyst's amount (50 mu L) and concentration of para-np (0.1587 mM).
   AN-5% also exhibited excellent catalytic activity towards different
   nitro substituted phenols, viz. ortho-np (2-nitrophenol), meta-np
   (3-nitrophenol), para-np (4-nitrophenol) and tri-np
   (2,4,6-trinitrophenol). AN-5% displayed similar to 100% catalytic
   efficiency for reducing meta-np in 2 min with the apparent first order
   rate constant (k(app)) and normalized rate constant (K-nor) as 1.99
   s(-1) and 398.14 s(-1) g(-1), respectively. Additionally, AN-5% (29.41
   mu g mL(-1)) reduced >95% of the colouring dyes (10 ppm) such as CONG-R
   (congo red: 95% in 6 min), METH-O (methyl orange: 97.5% in 7 min),
   METH-B (methylene blue: 98.3% in 10 min) and RHOD-B (rhodamine B: 99.2%
   in 5 min). AN-5% not only demonstrated catalytic reduction towards
   individual pollutants, but also showed excellent activity for reduction
   of the mixtures of nitrophenols/dyes and for treatment of simulated
   industrial effluent samples (EFF1, EFF2) and a real industrial sample
   (textile dye-bath effluent). AN-5% can also be reused up to several
   cycles with almost same efficiency and followed the Langmuir-Hinshelwood
   apparent first order kinetics model.

AB In this study, fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) in real
   printing and dyeing wastewater (PDW) during full-scale two-stage
   treatment was characterized using excitation-emission matrix (EEM),
   apparent molecular weight (AMW) cutoff by centrifugal ultrafiltration
   and high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detector
   (HPLC-FLD). EEMs of PDW during treatment were relatively invariable with
   two typical and dominant peaks (P1, 275/320 nm and P2, 230/340 nm). The
   removal rates of P1 intensity and P2 intensity were both lower than
   those of DOC or UVA(254) during the 1st stage and 2nd stage treatment.
   The <3 kDa fraction made major contribution to DOC, UVA(254), P1 and P2
   intensity. The DOM fractions with different AMW exhibited different
   removal behaviors during the 1st stage and 2nd stage treatment. The <3
   kDa fraction of FDOM was poorly removed by biological treatment alone.
   The HPLC-FLD multi-emission scan results indicated that the major part
   of FDOM clusters were hydrophilic and they were more difficult to remove
   than the transphilic and hydrophobic FDOM clusters. According to the
   physicochemical properties of FDOM in PDW, selective adsorption and
   advanced oxidation process could be prior options for PDW advanced
   treatment. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   using an electrocoagulation process (EC) coupled with activated carbon
   (AC) adsorption. The process variables were optimized using multivariate
   regression coupled with nonlinear programming with nonlinear
   restrictions to achieve the lowest possible cost while keeping a high
   enough degradation rate for chemical oxygen demand (COD), color, and
   turbidity to fulfill the Colombian environmental regulation
   requirements. Under optimal conditions (pH = 5.4, sigma =2 mS/cm, j =14
   mA/cm(2), and t = 11 min) color, COD, and TOC removals of 95%, 63%, and
   51%, respectively, were achieved. The biodegradability index also
   increased from 0.13 to 0.29, whereas toxicity tests showed a remaining
   toxicity of 45%. A kinetic study was conducted for the EC process. The
   activated carbon (AC) adsorption process was successfully used to
   completely remove toxicity, while further increasing color, COD, and TOC
   removals to 96%, 72%, and 61%, respectively. The conditions for the AC
   adsorption process (20 g/L of AC and 1 h) were determined by
   experimental adsorption isotherms and kinetic studies. The optimized
   EC/AC process led to an effluent satisfying the Colombian regulations
   and seems technologically viable with lower costs than other similar
   process that were reported in previous works.

AB If we can use toxic aromatic compounds as supplementary carbon source,
   the simultaneous removal of nitrate (NO3-) and aromatic compounds may be
   achieved at much lower chemical costs. This study uses the expanded
   granular sludge bed (EGSB) reactors to investigate the hypersaline (>
   3%) denitrification performance, the removal of aromatic compounds,
   i.e., aniline, phenol, and their mixture, and the mechanisms involved
   in. The four reactors exhibit high removal efficiency of NO3- (> 92.8%)
   and aromatic compounds (> 73.9%) at 0-1200mg/L of aromatic compounds.
   The formation of toxic intermediates such as catechol and azo dyes is
   revealed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with and
   without N,O-Bis(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) derivation,
   and their toxic effects lead to the lower cell survival ratios after
   exposing to phenol (64.2%  68.9%) than to aniline and mixture (72.7% 
   78.0%). The stable performance is associated with the more secretion of
   extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and the adsorption of
   pollutants on EPS, and this was indicated from the higher fluorescence
   intensity in three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix (3D-EEM).
   Moreover, the Halomonas and Azoarcus show high abundance and play
   important roles in the removal of both NO3- and aromatic compounds.
   Besides, quantitative real time PCR (RT-qPCR) results demonstrate the
   key role of highly abundant nosZ and nirS genes in denitrification. The
   toxic organics in industrial wastewaters are potentially feasible carbon
   sources for denitrification even under high-salinity stress.

AB The concentration of hazardous pollutants in the wastewater streams has
   to keep below a certain level in order to comply with the stringent
   environmental laws. The conventional technologies for wastewater
   treatment have drawbacks in terms of limited applicability and
   efficiency. Utilization of hydrodynamic cavitation (HC) reactors for the
   degradation of pollutants at large scale has shown considerable promise
   over last few years, due to higher energy efficiencies and low cost
   operation based on lower consumption of chemicals for the treatment. The
   present work overviews the degradation of different pollutants, such as
   pharmaceuticals, pesticide, phenolic derivatives and dyes, as well as
   the treatment of real industrial effluents using hybrid methods based on
   HC viz. HC/H2O2, HC/Ozone, HC/Fenton, HC/Ultraviolet irradiations (UV),
   and HC coupled with biological oxidation. Furthermore, based on the
   literature reports, recommendations for the selection of optimum
   operating parameters, such as inlet pressure, solution temperature,
   initial pH and initial pollutant concentration have been discussed in
   order to maximize the process intensification benefits. Moreover, hybrid
   methods based on HC has been demonstrated to show good synergism as
   compared to individual treatment approach. Overall, high energy
   efficient wastewater treatment can be achieved using a combined
   treatment approach based on HC under optimized conditions.

AB Reactive dyes are frequently applied in textile industries owing to
   varied color and texture. Treatment of such dye laden wastewater from
   textile industry is a major problem. Over the last few decades the most
   convenient removal mechanism adopted was adsorption using conventional
   adsorbents. Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous compounds with
   metal ionic network bridged using organic ligands possessing high
   surface area, adjustable pore size and high stability. In this study, an
   in depth investigation of adsorption of toxic reactive dyes on
   MIL-101-Cr MOF was undertaken. Four reactive dyes (reactive yellow 15,
   reactive black 5, reactive red 24 and reactive blue 2) were adsorbed
   onto highly porous MIL-101-Cr MOF from their aqueous solution. Real life
   study with industrial dye laden wastewater was also investigated. The
   process was simulated using a multi-component modeling derived from
   first principles to understand the interaction among the dye molecules
   and between the adsorbate and adsorbent. The adsorbent was characterized
   using scanning electron microscopy, BET surface area, FTIR, particle
   size and zeta potential. Reactive dyes were completely adsorbed in pH
   range 3.0-10.0. Maximum Langmuir adsorption capacities of nascent
   MIL-101-Cr for above mentioned dyes were in the range of 377-397 mg/g at
   room temperature (30 degrees C). Effects of pH, temperature, salt
   concentration, adsorbent dosing and kinetic study for the adsorbent
   dosing were investigated. Regeneration efficiency of the spent
   MIL-101-Cr adsorbent was also envisaged.

AB This study was conducted to select electrogenic bacteria from wastewater
   sludge. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Proteobacteria was the
   dominant phylum in the microbial fuel cell (MFC) during the
   decomposition process of organic pollutants. Five culturable bacteria
   strains - namely, Bacillus subtilis, Flavobacterium sp., Aeromonas
   hydrophila, Citrobacter freundii, and Stenotrophomonas sp. - have a
   double potential in dye removal and electricity generation. We
   inoculated the mixed electrogenic bacteria at a specific ratio and
   treated them with a triphenylmethane dye, Victoria blue R (VBR), to
   evaluate their electricity generation ability for the artificial and
   real wastewater. The results of the VBR shock-loading experiment
   indicated that the inoculated MFC could adapt to shock loading in
   1-2days and exhibited high removal efficiency (95-100%) for 100-800mg
   L-1 VBR with a power density of 8.62 +/- 0.10 to 34.81 +/- 0.25mW m(-2).
   The selected electrogenic bacteria in the MFC could use VBR as only
   electron donor for power generation. The matrix effects of the real
   wastewater on VBR removal and electricity generation of MFC were
   insignificant. VBR degradation by the electrogenic bacteria involves a
   stepwise demethylation process to yield partially dealkylated VBR
   species. In addition, these results demonstrate the feasibility of
   inoculating culturable bacteria strains to develop an efficient MFC for
   purifying wastewater.

AB Heterogeneous Fenton-like catalyst and its industrial application are
   increasingly given importance for its non-selective mineralization of
   organic pollutants in broad pH range. Current study, utilized an
   aromatic hydroxamic acid derivative 2-hydroxypyridine-N-oxide (HpO), for
   the construction of iron-Hpo ligand catalyst supported on granular
   activated carbon (GAC). 8-Hydroxyquinoline and citric acid as
   non-hydroxamic aromatic and aliphatic Fenton-like catalysts were used
   for comparative evaluation of the efficiency with targeted catalyst
   (iron-HpO-GAC). This novel catalyst iron-HpO-GAC exhibits excellent
   efficiency in Acid Red 88 dye removal in the presence of hydrogen
   peroxide as oxidant at acidic, basic as well as at neutral conditions.
   Operational conditions for the catalytic oxidation including
   temperature, dye concentration, pH and catalyst dosage were
   systematically investigated and analyzed through kinetic studies.
   Thermodynamic analysis of the catalytic dye removal revealed that the
   system could oxidize pollutants faster with less activation energy
   requirement. Higher level of recyclability and stability of the catalyst
   with less iron leaching was achieved. Finally, the real time application
   of the catalyst was investigated through successful repeated treatment
   for actual industrial wastewater. The phytotoxicity assay (with respect
   to plant Phaseolus mungo) revealed that the degradation of Acid Red 88
   and dye wastewater produced nontoxic metabolites which increases its
   potential application. This study emphasizes the viability of
   hydroxamate mediated efficient Fenton-like oxidation as a novel approach
   in designing economically viable pollutant removal technology.

AB Adsorption of fluoride from fertilizer industry effluent using carbon
   nanotubes stabilized in chitosan sponge as adsorbent was evaluated. The
   effluent was produced in the washing of acid gases during the reaction
   in fertilizer production and all assays were performed using this
   hazardous material. Adsorbent characterization and ions interactions
   were elucidated from differential scanning calorimetry, thermal
   gravimetric analyses, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy
   dispersive energy X-ray spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy. The effluent presented pH 3 and its value
   not changed in the adsorption assays, maintaining the conditions of the
   process. The kinetics assays of fluoride from industry effluent were
   performed in different stirring rates from 100 to 300 rpm. It was
   observed that adsorption was initially fast reaching the equilibrium at
   300 rpm in 20 min. The adsorption capacity was around 975.4 mg g(-1),
   showing the potential of the hybrid material to remove fluoride from a
   real matrix. The high adsorption capacity was attributed to the chitosan
   functional groups and the high interaction area promoted by sponge form
   and the carbon nanotube. Reuse and regeneration of the CNT-CS were
   investigated and 5 cycles were obtained. The adsorption capacity kept
   similar values in all cycles.

AB The application of wastewater treatment using TiO2 coated on the
   stainless-steel mesh is promising for disintegrating organic pollutants
   in wastewater. This research successfully coated TiO2 particles on
   stainless-steel mesh for the photocatalyst process by using the
   dip-coating method. This method was selected due to its simplicity and
   low cost, as well as its extensive application prospects in wastewater
   treatment. The photocatalytic oxidation of real wastewater treatment was
   developed and designed for a photo-reactor in terms of flow rate (varied
   on 2.0-4.0 L/min) and light distance (varied on 5.0-15.0 cm), whereas
   the preparation of the material process was investigated in terms of
   TiO2 catalyst dosage (varied on 1.0-3.0 g) and layers of coating (varied
   on 1 to 3 layers). Experiments were employed to degrade organic
   wastewater from methylene blue (MB) for a prelim experiment and real
   wastewater effluent testing for the application. The optimized TiO2
   dosage was 2.0 g with 2 layers of coating coated on the stainless-steel
   mesh. The designed photo-reactor was optimized with a flow rate of 2.0
   L/min and a light distance of 10.0 cm to treat the organic pollutants in
   raw domestic wastewater effluent on photocatalytic activity. MB
   successfully degraded about 96% in 3 h under UV-C irradiation after
   adsorption equilibrium was completed (3 h), whereas the efficiency of
   BOD removal was 89% under UV-C irradiation in 4 h. Therefore, TiO2 (2.0
   g) coated on stainless-steel mesh with 2 layers of the coating prepared
   by dip-coating is a potentially effective alternative for real
   wastewater treatment.

AB A rapid Fenton treatment at second-scale intervals was investigated for
   further removal of organic compounds in the effluent of bio-treated
   dyeing and finishing wastewater (BDFW). The decolorization kinetics was
   studied using a stopped-flow spectrophotometer (SFS) at second-scale
   intervals. A combined first-order model was found to fit well for the
   decrease of both methylene blue and rhodamine B in SFS as well as SCOD
   (soluble chemical oxygen demand) and DOC (dissolved organic carbon) in
   real BDFW in batch test during Fenton oxidation. A full-scale plant with
   treatment capacity of 400,000 m(3).d(-1) was designed and has been run
   continuously based on the results of the stopped-flow study to treat the
   effluent of BDFW using Fenton oxidation in 16 pipeline reactors, each
   with a volume of 6.9 m(3) and 24 s of reaction time since 2014. The COD,
   SCOD and DOC decreased from 140, 110 and 35 mg.L-1 to 77, 71 and 26
   mg.L-1 respectively, which can meet the latest strict discharge
   limitations. The natural fluorescent substances detected in the BDFW
   were completely removed. The main organic pollutants in the BDFW can be
   significantly reduced using both gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
   and ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-hybrid quadrupole
   time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The rapid Fenton reaction applied in
   pipeline reactors at second intervals has several advantages over the
   conventional Fenton's process such as much shorter reaction time at
   second scale intervals, no need to build extra pH adjustment or reaction
   tanks, simple operation, low capital cost, etc.

AB A novel magnetic lignin-based adsorbent modified with sodium citrate
   (L-SC@Fe3O4) was simply manufactured by one-step hydrothermal method to
   eliminate calcium ions and methylene blue from aqueous solution. Various
   characterization methods were applied to explore the structural
   morphological features of the obtained sample. The as-designed adsorbent
   possessed high specific surface area, rough surface and rich mesoporous
   structure. Adsorption experimental data accorded with the Langmuir
   isotherm with maximum adsorption amount of 339.4 mg/g and 281.4 mg/g for
   calcium ions and methylene blue, respectively. Kinetic data fitted well
   with the pseudo-second-order model. Furthermore, the adsorption mass
   transfer process of calcium ions and methylene blue was predicted by the
   pore volume diffusion model, virtually governed by intraparticle
   resistance. The adsorbent showed considerable efficiency toward calcium
   ions and methylene blue within a broad pH range of 4-8 and 4-10,
   separately. The resulting adsorbent also exhibited strong anti-salts
   interference and possessed good regenerability with magnetic separation
   feasibility. Altogether, the tailor-made magnetic adsorbent is promising
   as an efficient and sustainable adsorbent for calcium ions and methylene
   blue removal, illuminating the future design of competent adsorbents for
   scavenging metal ions and dyes from real complex waste liquid.

AB A novel, bio-derived cyclodextrin-based trifunctional adsorbent has been
   successfully synthesized for efficient, rapid and simultaneous removal
   of a broad-spectrum of toxic ionic (anionic and cationic dyes) and
   non-ionic organic pollutants from water. The composition, morphology and
   the presence of functional groups in the obtained sorption material were
   characterized by elemental analysis, XRD, SEM, and FTIR spectroscopy.
   The adsorption results were represented by cationic dye (crystal violet,
   CV) and endocrine disrupting compound (bisphenol A, BPA) as an
   adsorbate. The sorption processes of the model pollutants were studied
   with both kinetic and equilibrium models. The results showed that the
   sorption was rapid (less than 1 min) and the time evolution could be
   fitted using a pseudo-second order model. According to Langmuir isotherm
   model, the maximum adsorption capacities were found at 113.64 and 43.10
   mg g(-1) for BPA and CV, respectively. The adsorption ability of
   beta-CDPs was kept nearly on the same level after five regeneration
   cycles. Furthermore, almost complete removal of the pollutants was
   observed during the treatment of real effluents samples thus the
   bio-derived, cheap and reusable BAN-EPI-CDP has a promising potential
   for practical applications.

AB Dyes are colored compounds which are visible even at trace
   concentrations. Due to their recalcitrance and esthetic persistence,
   certain methods are unable to effectively eliminate them. So far,
   adsorptive treatment using activated carbons (ACs) is one of the most
   successful methods. In this study, we have employed orange peel (OP) as
   a cost-effective alternative to the expensive coal- and coir-based
   precursors to synthesize ACs for cationic methylene blue (MB) and
   anionic methyl orange (MO) dye adsorption. The pre-carbonized OP was
   activated via H2SO4, NaOH, KOH, ZnCl2, and H3PO4 to study the effects of
   activation reagents on dye removal efficiencies and mechanisms. Among
   several isotherm models employed to fit the adsorption data, the
   Langmuir and Sips models sufficiently estimated the maximum equilibrium
   uptakes close to the experimental values of 1012.10 +/- 29.13, 339.82
   +/- 6.98, and 382.15 +/- 8.62 mg/g, for ZnCl2-AC (MO), ZnCl2-AC (MB),
   and KOH-AC (MB), respectively. The adsorption mechanisms were suggested
   to involve electrostatic binding, pi-pi interactions, hydrogen bonding,
   and electron donor-acceptor reactions. Consequently, more than 99%
   removal efficiency was achieved from a laboratory organic wastewater
   sample bearing 35 mg/L of MB. The results thus suggest that the
   synthesized ACs from agricultural waste have the tendencies to be
   applied to real dye wastewater treatment.

AB Effective immobilization of industrial waste into biochar development
   could be one of the most promising technologies for solid waste
   management to achieve circular economy. In this study, post-industrial
   cotton textile waste (PICTW), a cellulose rich industrial waste, was
   subjected to slow pyrolysis to develop a surface engineered biochar
   through phosphoric acid impregnation. Biochar produced at 500 degrees C
   designated as PICTWB500 showed a maximum methylene blue number (240 mg
   g-1) with remarkable specific surface area of 1498 m2 g-1. FESEM, FTIR,
   XRD and Raman spectra analysis were performed to investigate the surface
   texture and functionalities developed in the biochar. Adsorption
   efficiency of the biochar was assessed using drimarene red, blue,
   violet, and black dyes as model dye pollutants in batch mode at
   different biochar dose, pH and contact time. The maximum monolayer
   adsorption capacity was obtained in the range 285-325 mg g-1 for
   different dyes, determined from Langmuir adsorption model. The kinetic
   behaviour was more favourable with the pseudo second-order model. The
   recycling ability of PICTWB500 was proven to be effective up to 6th
   cycle without compromising its adsorption efficiency significantly. This
   study demonstrated an excellent adsorption capability of the biochar in
   dye laden real textile effluent and recycling of spent biochar as a
   precursor of bio compost. Hence, this study established a dual win
   strategy for waste utilization in textile industry using a closed loop
   approach with substantial techno-economic feasibility that may have
   potential applications.

AB The industrialization, growing population, and human activities (e.g.,
   liquid waste of households, industrial units, and agricultural lands)
   are the main causes to contaminate fresh water sources. To overcome this
   issue, many techniques have been applied for water purification and
   chemical oxidation is one of the effective ways to treat the wastewater
   called as advanced oxidation process (AOPs). In the present study,
   synthesized silver phosphate nanoparticles were employed as catalysts in
   the photocatalytic advanced oxidation process for the degradation of
   various dyes (RhB, MB, MO, and OG) and drug (SMZ). The photocatalyst was
   characterized through different analytical tools, e.g., PXRD, FTIR,
   UV-Vis DRS, DLS, FESEM, and HRTEM. The chemical behavior or interaction
   of dye molecule with catalyst surface has also been explored to
   understand the mechanism of photodegradation reaction. All the organic
   dyes and drugs showed pseudo first-order rate kinetics and it was found
   that RhB dye and SMZ drug degraded so fast by the photocatalyst. The
   maximum observed photodegradation rate was 0.0744 min(-1) for SMZ drug
   and 0.0532 min(-1) for RhB dye, respectively. The minimum dye
   degradation was observed similar to 0.0036 min(-1) for OG, which is
   similar to 15 times lesser than the degradation rate of RhB dye. From
   the comparative dye degradation study, it was found that the
   photodegradation efficiency of organic pollutants depends on the surface
   charge of the photocatalyst. The role of photogenerated reactive species
   (holes, superoxides, and hydroxyl free radicals) was also studied using
   different types of scavengers which helped to understand the
   photochemical reactions and mechanism by photocatalyst. The real sample
   analysis of textile effluent was also performed using the best
   photocatalyst in the presence of light.

AB Adsorption of Sunset yellow (SY) onto cadmium hydroxide nanowires loaded
   on activated carbon (Cd(OH)(2)-NW-AC) and silver nanoparticles loaded on
   activated carbon (Ag-NP-AC) was investigated. The effects of pH, contact
   time, amount of adsorbents, initial dye concentration, agitation speed
   and temperature on Sunset yellow removal on both adsorbents were
   studied. Following the optimization of variables, the experimental data
   were fitted to different conventional isotherm models like Langmuir,
   Freundlich, Tempkin and Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) based on linear
   regression coefficient R-2 the Langmuir isotherm was found to be the
   best fitting isotherm model and the maximum monolayer adsorption
   capacities calculated based on this model for Cd(OH)(2)-NW-AC and
   Ag-NP-AC were found to be 76.9 and 37.03 mgg(-1) at room temperatures,
   respectively. The experimental fitting of time dependency of adsorption
   of SY onto both adsorbent shows the applicability of second order
   kinetic model for interpretation of kinetic data. The pseudo-second
   order model best fits the adsorption kinetics. Thermodynamic parameters
   such as enthalpy, entropy, activation energy, sticking probability, and
   Gibb's free energy changes were also calculated. It was found that the
   sorption of SY over (Cd(OH)(2)-NW-AC) and (Ag-NP-AC) was spontaneous and
   endothermic in nature. Efficiency of the adsorbent was also investigated
   using real effluents and more than 95% SY removal for both adsorbents
   was observed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Industrial effluents contain a wide range of organic pollutants that
   present harmful effects on the environment and deprived communities with
   no access to clean water. As this organic matter is resistant to
   conventional treatments, Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) have
   emerged as a suitable option to counteract these environmental
   challenges. Engineered iron oxide nanoparticles have been widely tested
   in AOPs catalysis, but their full potential as magnetic induction
   self-heating catalysts has not been studied yet on real and highly
   contaminated industrial wastewaters. In this study we have designed a
   self-heating catalyst with a finely tuned structure of small cores (10
   nm) aggregates to develop multicore particles (40 nm) with high magnetic
   moment and high colloidal stability. This nanocatalyst, that can be
   separated by magnetic harvesting, is able to increase reaction
   temperatures (up to 90 degrees C at 1 mg/mL suspension in 5 min) under
   the action of alternating magnetic fields. This efficient heating was
   tested in the degradation of a model compound (methyl orange) and real
   wastewaters, such as leachate from a solid landfill (LIX) and colored
   wastewater from a textile industry (TIW). It was possible to increase
   reaction rates leading to a reduction of the chemical oxygen demand of
   50 and 90%, for TIW and LIX. These high removal and degradation ability
   of the magnetic nanocatalyst was sustained with the formation of strong
   reactive oxygen species by a Fenton-like mechanism as proved by electron
   paramagnetic resonance. These findings represent an important advance
   for the industrial implementation of a scalable, non-toxic, self-heating
   catalysts that can certainly enhance AOP for wastewater treatment in a
   more sustainable and efficient way.

AB p-nitroaniline (PNA) is a common contaminant in the petrochemical
   industry wastewater, which is resulted from the production of
   pesticides, dyes and glues. In this research, PNA degradation was
   investigated by ozonation (O-3) with ultraviolet radiation (O-3/UV) in
   the aqueous solution. Moreover, the effective parameters such as initial
   concentration of PNA, input supply rate of ozone, contact times and pH
   were investigated and optimized. The experiments were carried out in
   optimal conditions on coal washing plant wastewater as a real sample.
   The optimal conditions were as follows: initial PNA concentration = 10
   mg/L, ozone input supply rate = 0.9 g/h, contact time = 40 minutes, and
   pH = 9. The highest PNA degradation of the process under the optimal
   conditions in the synthetic solution and real examples was obtained 94%
   and 81%, respectively. In the synthetic samples, when the reaction time
   was more than 30 minutes, the TOC maximum removal efficiency was
   obtained 81%. Evaluation of kinetics linear models indicated that the
   data followed pseudo-first-order kinetics. According to the results, the
   mentioned process could be a suitable method for PNA degradation from
   industrial wastewater.

AB Implementing forward osmosis (FO) into textile wastewater treatment
   process can provide high value to an industry segment which is a large
   consumer of fresh water and one of the biggest polluters. In this study
   real textile wastewater was used as feed solution with 1M NaCl, 1M
   MgCl2, blue dye mixture, and green dye mixture as draw solution in FO.
   Pre-determined concentrations of green and blue dye mixtures based on
   final desired concentrations (for further use in dyeing process), gave
   comparable water flux with 1M NaCl and 1M MgCl2, however, slightly
   higher reverse salt flux values were obtained with dyes compared to the
   inorganic salts. Long-term filtration followed by chemical cleaning of
   the FO membranes tested resulted in 100% flux recovery with negligible
   irreversible fouling. Membrane surface characterisation (zeta potential,
   contact angle, SEM and ATR-FTIR) confirmed efficient FO membrane
   cleaning and complete flux recovery. Rejection performance of the FO
   membranes for COD rejection was >94% with up to 55% water recovery. The
   rejection of TDS, TSS, Zn2+, and SO42- were all >99%. Using the obtained
   results an OPEX/CAPEX analysis demonstrated the economic feasibility of
   using the FO process in textile wastewater treatment system. (C) 2018

AB Industrial textile wastewater is usually characterized by high pH,
   intense color and extremely high salinity, especially in case of
   wastewater generated after dyeing. Due to the complex matrix of textile
   wastewater, the selection of an appropriate treatment method can be a
   challenge. This paper presents the advantages of coupling
   electrocoagulation (EC) and ozonation (O-3) as one-step (EC + O-3) and
   two-step (EC -> O-3) operations. The combination of EC and O-3, which
   both worked well in salty environment, gave very good results in the
   case of aqueous solutions and real industrial wastewater containing
   Reactive Black 5 (RB5). Very high color removal, more than 95%, was
   achieved in a very short treatment time (less than 18 min, while ca. 60
   min was required in the case of individual O-3). At the same time the
   applied ozone dose was reduced from 1.69 g/L, when using O-3 only, to
   less than 0.3 g/L for EC -> O-3. The results of color removal and
   mineralization analysis indicated the high efficiency of both the EC +
   O-3 and EC -> O-3 processes; however, the cost evaluation revealed that
   the EC -> O-3 treatment was more advantageous. EC preformed as a single
   treatment resulted in an increase in toxicity, but coupling EC with O-3
   reduced this undesirable effect. Very promising results were obtained in
   recycling trials. The color difference (DEcmc, according to ISO 105-J03)
   of textiles dyed with purified wastewater (brine) were between 0.28 and
   0.98 (below the limiting value of 1.5).

AB Industrial wastewater treatment is one of the greatest challenges of
   humanity that require an increased awareness to address water scarcity
   worldwide. Herein, an eco-friendly and cost-effective approach was
   established to cope with real textile and tannery effluents via the
   biosynthesis of highly adsorbent magnesium oxide nanoparticles
   (MgO-NPs). Physicochemical characterization of as-formed MgO-NPs
   confirms the successful fabrication of MgO nano-rods (30-85 nm) and
   nano-rectangular (18.6-27.6 nm) by harnessing metabolites secreted by
   Aspergillus niger strain F1. Moreover, the energy dispersive
   spectroscopy (EDX) confirms that Mg and O are the main components in the
   sample with weight percentages of 41.1% and 33.6%, respectively. X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirms the successful formation of
   MgO at different bending energies. The catalytic degradation and
   decolorization analyses were conducted under sunlight and dark
   conditions. These analyses demonstrated that the highest decolorization
   of real textile and tannery effluents (92.8% +/- 0.06% and 97.5% +/-
   0.7%, respectively) was accomplished after 180 min by treatment with 1.0
   mg mL(-1) of MgO-NPs in the presence of sunlight. At optimum
   experimental conditions, the quality of treated effluents was monitored
   by the reduction of total suspended solid (TSS), total dissolved solid
   (TDS), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) levels at the percentages of
   86.9% +/- 0.8%, 77.0% +/- 0.8%, and 89.3% +/- 0.9%, respectively, for
   textile effluent and the percentages of 94.3% +/- 1.6%, 80.7% +/- 1.6%,
   and 97.4% +/- 0.9% respectively, for tannery effluent. The reusability
   of MgO-NPs showed its activity for textile effluents treatment for four
   cycles. Biosynthesized MgO-NPs showed a high adsorption capacity for
   predominant tannery heavy metals, namely, Cr, Co, Pb, Cd, and Ni having
   removal percentages of 94.2% +/- 1.2%, 63.4% +/- 1.7%, 72.7% +/- 1.3%,
   74.1% +/- 1.8%, and 70.8% +/- 1.5%, respectively. The toxicity of
   treated effluents was assessed by the germination of corn and broad bean
   seeds, which exhibited a decreased toxicity as compared with untreated
   effluents. Interestingly, the biosynthesized MgO-NPs exhibit
   antimicrobial activity against different pathogenic microbes and their
   activities were dose-dependent.

AB In this study, a series of novel metal organic framework based composite
   materials was synthesized using a facile combustion synthesis method.
   The synthesized materials were characterized using standard analytical
   tech-niques for crystallite size, surface functional groups, surface
   area, porosity, optical properties, and particle size. The increase in
   the amount of CuO in the composite material resulted decrease in surface
   area and pore volume. The band-gap energy of the synthesized composites
   reduced with increase in the amount of CuO. Among the composite, 0.9
   CuO:0.1 MIL displayed least emission intensity indicating lower
   electron-hole recombination and thereby superior charge separation of
   the material. The increase in the amount of CuO NPs in the composite
   resulted in increase in the average particle size and decrease in the
   zeta potential. As an application, the NaBH4-mediated reduction of
   Methyl orange dye was studied using the synthesized materials. The
   increased amount of CuO in the composite resulted in the higher activity
   of the material. Highest activity was observed with the composite
   containing 9:1 ratio of CuO and MIL, and this material was further used
   to investigate the reduction of methylene blue, Rhodamine B,
   4-nitrophenol, 2-nitrophenol, and 2, 4-dichloro-phenol. The material
   exhibited excellent activity for all the selected organic pollutants.
   Finally, the composite containing 9:1 ratio of CuO and MIL was employed
   for the reduction of a real-time industry effluent and the observed
   results were encouraging. The reusability aspect of the synthesized
   material was investigated. Based on the LC-MS analysis, a possible
   reduction mechanism is proposed.

AB The biosorption potential of three fungal waste-biomasses (Acremonium
   strictum, Acremonium sp. and Penicillium sp.) from pharmaceutical
   companies was compared with that of a selected biomass (Cunninghamella
   elegans), already proven to be very effective in dye biosorption. Among
   the waste-biomasses, A. strictum was the most efficient (decolorization
   percentage up to 90% within 30 min) with regard to three simulated dye
   baths; nevertheless it was less active than C. elegans which was able to
   produce a quick and substantial decolorization of all the simulated dye
   baths (up to 97% within 30 min). The biomasses of A. strictum and C.
   elegans were then tested for the treatment of nine real exhausted dye
   baths. A. strictum was effective at acidic or neutral pH, whereas C.
   elegans confirmed its high efficiency and versatility towards exhausted
   dye baths characterised by different classes of dyes (acid, disperse,
   vat, reactive) and variation in pH and ionic strength. Finally, the
   effect of pH on the biosorption process was evaluated to provide a
   realistic estimation of the validity of the laboratory results in an
   industrial setting. The C. elegans biomass was highly effective from pH
   3 to pH 11 (for amounts of adsorbed dye up to 1054 and 667 mg of dye
   g(-1) biomass dry weight, respectively); thus, this biomass can be
   considered an excellent and exceptionally versatile biosorbent material.

   wastewater by Bigadic clinoptilolite was performed using Response
   Surface Methodology (RSM) by means of Minitab 17 programme. The applied
   experimental parameters were pH, dosage and temperature. The obtained
   optimum conditions were pH 4, temperature 15 degrees C and dosage 1 g/50
   ml. The optimiser and contour plots were used for optimisation of data
   set, and regression models were developed for calculation of model
   responses for a given any experimental parameters. Adsorbent capacity
   (q), COD and colour removal (%) values determined by RSM at optimum
   conditions were 31.01 mg/g, 61.8 and 29.69, respectively.

   reactive violet 1(RV1) dye at alkaline pH. Dye decolorization by the
   microbe was tested first in nutrient broth by varying initial dye
   concentration (50-3000 mg/L), pH (7.0-12.0), inoculum size (1-10%) and
   temperature (4-45 degrees C) by spectrometric determination of
   absorbance at 550 nm, using single parameter approach. Box Behnken
   Design model of Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was then used to
   obtain optimized combination of process parameters for best dye
   degrading response of the microbe, based on 46 experiments. The microbe
   is found effective under a wide range of conditions and showed excellent
   reusability up to 6 batch cycles. Short term acclimatization in repeated
   cycles made decolorization faster and greater. Growth of the microbe was
   favored at high pH (11.5) and in the presence of salts (2.5-5%),
   decolorizing 94-100% of the dye. Decolorization of the dye by the
   microbe was also studied in simulated and real textile wastewaters under
   the optimized process conditions using 1% starch as carbon supplement.
   The bacterium degraded the dye and also bioremediated the wastewaters by
   successfully moderating the pH, removing toxic metal Cr (VI) and
   chemical oxygen demand (COD) during treatment. (C) 2019 Published by

AB Dimorcarpus longan ssp. malesianus var. Malesianus (Mata Kuching) leaves
   (MKL) show a strong affinity toward crystal violet (CV), a commonly used
   industrial dye. Treatment of MKL with aqueous 1.0 M NaOH solution
   through stirring for 2.0 h, followed by washing and drying, enhances the
   adsorption of CV onto the modified adsorbent (NaOH-MKL), due to the
   conversion of acidic functional groups to the corresponding anionic
   forms leading to stronger Coulombic attractions. The performance of MKL
   and its modified NaOH-MKL toward CV dye adsorption indicates a strong
   attraction of both adsorbents. Strong adsorption of CV molecules to MKL
   and NaOH-MKL is evidenced by changes in the Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopic peaks and scanning electron microscopic images upon
   interaction with the adsorbate. The Sips isotherm, among the five
   adsorption isotherm models used in this study, is suitable in explaining
   the interaction of both adsorbents with CV dye molecules. The maximum
   adsorption capacity (q(max)) of NaOH-MKL adsorbent toward CV is 391.7 mg
   g(-1) under optimum conditions according to the Sips adsorption
   isotherm, which is 88% enhancement over the unmodified MKL with q(max)
   of 208.1 mg g(-1). Approach of CV dye molecules onto MKL/NaOH-MKL for
   adsorption is explained by the pseudo-second-order kinetics with an
   apparent rate constant of 6.108 g mmol(-1) min(-1), which is 72%
   increase over MKL. The superior nature of NaOH-MKL would make it an
   excellent sorbent for the removal of CV dye, which would thus have the
   potential for extrapolation toward real applications in the treatment of
   wastewater.

   using stainless steel (SS) plate electrodes operated in batch mode in a
   bipolar parallel arrangement. Batch ECC studies with four plate
   electrodes operating at a reasonable low applied cell voltage of 3 V was
   identified as an optimal operating condition for more or less complete
   removal of 90% organics. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal as much as
   80% could be achieved at low current densities up to 1.5 mA/cm(2),
   beyond which COD removals declined; ascribed to higher electrode
   dissolution and generation of excess concentration of Fe2+. Total
   dissolved solids (TDS) values were reduced from 2018 to <1000 mg/L
   within 50 min of electrolysis time (ET) irrespective of the cell voltage
   applied. similar to 60% of the colloidal matter was removed within 25-35
   min of ET recording the shortest treatment time (low Hydraulic retention
   time (HRT)) at very low energy consumption. The presence of chloride
   ions significantly reduced energy consumption because of oxidation
   mediated by active chloride ions. 2115 kWh/m(3) electrical energy was
   sufficient to attain 80% COD removal with four plate electrodes. Water
   quality after ECC improved considerably achieving control on water
   quality parameters like, hardness, alkalinity, TS and chlorides to the
   desired value.

   polymer (M-LSP) was synthesized from lignosulfonate by solvent-free
   esterifying with maleic anhydride (MA) by one step, and was used to
   remove the dyes by adsorption. FT-IR and XPS were used to confirm
   successful preparation of M-LSP. The result is that: M-LSP is apt W
   adsorb cationic dye. In single system, the super adsorption performance
   of M-LSP for methylene blue (MB) is depended on the carboxyl content in
   M-LSP. M-LSP performs its remarkable adsorption performance for MB
   stably at pH 7.0 similar to 10.0, and the maximum adsorption capacity of
   M-LSP for MB is up to 613.5 mg/g according to Langmuir isotherm model.
   The Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetic models are more
   suitable to desoipt adsorption process of M-LSP for MB. In binary and
   ternary system, the M-LSP adsorbs the cationic dyes simultaneously, but
   selectively adsorbs MB. M-LSP can effectively remove cationic dyes in
   simulate dyestuff water. Moreover, the removal percentage of regenerated
   M-LSP decreases only 8.4% after 4 desorption-resorption cycles. The
   results indicated that M-LSP could be a candidate for remediation of
   real printing and dyeing or textile wastewater containing cationic dyes.

AB The coexistence of anionic dye, cationic dye and endocrine-disrupting
   chemicals (EDCs) in dyeing wastewater has highlighted a great necessity
   to develop new and effective approaches for their simultaneous removal.
   In this study, a novel amphoteric adsorbent was successfully synthesized
   using a two-step strategy, starting with the preparation of citric acid
   (CA) crosslinked beta-cyclodextrin (CD) polymer (CD/CA) through
   esterification reactions, followed by the grafting of 2-dimethylamino
   ethyl methacrylate monomer (PDMAEMA) through polymerization reaction.
   Adsorption performance of the synthesized material (CD/CA-g-PDMAEMA)
   toward EDCs (bisphenol A, BPA), cationic dye (methylene blue, MB) and
   anionic dye (methyl orange, MO) in the monocomponent and multicomponent
   systems were evaluated. The adsorbent showed a maximum adsorption
   capacity (q(max)) of 79.0 mg/g for BPA at pH 6.5, 165.8 mg/g for MO at
   pH 4.0 and 335.5 mg/g for MB at pH 11.0, respectively. By altering the
   solution pH, zeta-potential of the adsorbent could be changed, endowing
   the material with selective adsorption properties toward anionic or
   cationic dyes, while BPA adsorption efficiency was vastly insusceptible
   to the changes in solution pH from 2.0 to 10.0. These characteristics
   are beneficial for the application of CD/CA-g-PDMAEMA in real
   wastewaters treatment. In addition, the pseudo-second-order model fitted
   well with the experimental data in both monocomponent and multicomponent
   systems, and the adsorption mechanisms were proposed: BPA could form
   inclusion complex with beta-cyclodextrin cavities, while MB and MO
   molecules could interact with the carboxyl and tertiary amino groups on
   CD/CA-g-PDMAEMA through electrostatic attractions.

AB Eco-friendly biochar derived from the cost-effective and easily
   accessible agricultural waste corncob has been utilized as an adsorbent
   for decolorization of real textile dye wastewater (RTDW). Slow pyrolysis
   of the corncob was done in a temperature range of 450-550 degrees C with
   a consistent heating rate to produce biochar. The biochar yield reduced
   with increasing temperature of pyrolysis. Chemical treatment of biochar
   (BC) with sulfuric acid was done to improve the adsorption efficiency.
   Batch studies were carried out for decolorization of RTDW by varying key
   reaction parameters in order to further optimize these ones.
   Significantly high decolorization efficiency of up to 98 % was obtained
   using acid modified biochar (MBC). The maximum adsorption of dyes with
   MBC was found to be 6.02 mg g(-1)in 45 minutes at ambient temperature.
   Advance analytics including Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy,
   Scanning Electron Microscopy and Zeta Potential etc. were carried out to
   characterize the adsorbents and to see the changes during the pyrolysis
   and adsorption processes. The kinetic studies demonstrated that
   Lagergren's pseudo-II order model was the best fit for both BC and MBC.
   Also, MBC showed good recyclability as adsorbent when used two more
   times after degeneration. The germination % ofVigna radiata L. was
   studied to evaluate the toxicity of the effluents which depicted that
   dye wastewater after the adsorption by MBC was safe for agricultural
   use.

AB The catalytic effect of commercial microporous activated carbon (AC) and
   macroporous carbon nano tubes (CNT) is investigated in reductive
   bioreactions in continuous high rate anaerobic reactors, using the azo
   dye Acid Orange 10 (AO10) as model compound as electron acceptor and a
   mixture of VFA as electron donor. Size and concentration of carbon
   materials (CM) and hydraulic retention time (HRT) are assessed. CM
   increased the biological reduction rate of AO10, resulting in
   significantly higher colour removal, as compared to the control
   reactors. The highest efficiency, 98%, was achieved with a CNT diameter
   (d) lower than 0.25 mm, at a CNT concentration of 0.12 g per g of
   volatile solids (VS), a HRT of 10 h and resulted in a chemical oxygen
   demand (COD) removal of 85%. Reducing the HRT to 5 h, colour and COD
   removal in CM-mediated bioreactors were above 90% and 80%, respectively.
   In the control reactor, thought similar COD removal was achieved, AO10
   decolourisation was just approximately 20%, demonstrating the ability of
   CM to significantly accelerate the reduction reactions in continuous
   bioreactors. AO10 reduction to the correspondent aromatic amines was
   proved by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Colour decrease
   in the reactor treating a real effluent with CNT was the double
   comparatively to the reactor operated without CNT. The presence of AC in
   the reactor did not affect the microbial diversity, as compared to the
   control reactor, evidencing that the efficient reduction of AO10 was
   mainly due to AC rather than attributed to changes in the composition of
   the microbial communities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Silica colloid-polyelectrolyte-iron oxide nanocomposite with both
   magnetic and catalytic properties has been synthesized via
   layer-by-layer assembly. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and
   electrophoretic mobility measurements were employed to monitor the
   evolution of these structures from silica colloid to silica
   colloid-polyelectrolyte-iron oxide composite. In addition to DLS,
   transmission electron microscope was used to investigate the morphology
   of nanostructure synthesized at each stage. The final structure formed
   show good colloidal and catalytic stability and real time
   magnetophoretic response under low magnetic field gradient. Here we
   demonstrated the potential environmental engineering application of this
   nanocomposite by taking organic dye, Methylene Blue (MB) and Methyl
   Orange (MO), as our model system. The experiment was conducted by
   testing the capability of nanomaterials synthesized at each stage,
   namely silica colloid, polyelectrolyte-functionalized silica colloid
   (silica-PDDA), and silica colloid-polyelectrolyte-iron oxide composite
   (silica-PDDA-IOMNPs), for dye removal. By taking into account the
   electrostatic interactions between the dye molecules and the
   as-synthesized nanomaterials, we verified that silica
   colloid-polyelectrolyte-iron oxide composite is superior for pollutant
   removal from aqueous environment mainly due to its catalytic property.
   We rationalized our finding by performing (1) Langmuir and Freundlich
   adsorption analysis, and, (2) pseudo-first-order and pseudosecond-order
   kinetic study for all three species of aforementioned nanomaterials. The
   reusability of silica-PDDA-IOMNPs nanocomposite was tested by subjecting
   this nanomaterial for multiple cycle of dye removal process. This hybrid
   material remained catalytically active after six months of storage. (C)

   AFM, porosity, contact angle and SEM analyses and tested for filtration
   performances by using a model dye solution (reactive orange 16-RO16) and
   a real dye-bath textile wastewater. The pore size and density onto the

   the increasing of evaporation temperature. At the pretreatment
   filtration experiments, the flux values of membranes decreased largely

   solar irradiation, the europium-nitrogen (Eu-N) co-doped TiO2/Sepiolite
   nanocomposites were successfully fabricated via microwave-hydrothermal
   method. The effects of Eu and N contents on the chemical properties and
   crystal structure of the obtained nanocomposites were characterized. It
   was found that the carrier sepiolite was uniformly covered by doped-TiO2
   nanoparticles and the doped Eu is beneficial for the growth of anatase
   crystallite. Furthermore, doped N extended the absorption to the visible
   region, and the doped Eu-III increased the adsorption ability further.
   The visible-light photocatalytic activities of the samples were
   evaluated for degradation of orange G. The results showed that the
   co-doped sample presented enhanced photocatalytic activity compared to
   undoped and monodoped samples. The increase in degradation efficiency
   can be ascribed to the synergistic effects of Eu and N co-doping. Among
   all samples, the optimum Eu-III doped content was 0.6% for the co-doped
   sample. The co-doped sample can also effectively treat real textile dye
   wastewater with over 70% COD removal efficiency in 3 h of irradiation
   time. This research demonstrates the co-doped TiO2/Sepiolite
   nanocomposites have a prospective application in textile dye wastewater
   treatment.

AB In this research work, a new magnetic Schiff?s base-chitosan-Benzil/zinc
   oxide/Fe3O4 nanocomposite (Cs-Bz/ ZnO/Fe3O4) was developed to be a
   promising and recoverable adsorbent for Remazol Brilliant Blue R dye
   (RBBR) removal from the aquatic environment. Parametric optimization by
   Box-Behnken design was made to optimize the synthesis condition (loading
   ZnO nanoparticles into polymeric matrix of Cs) in addition to adsorption
   operation parameters (adsorbent dose, solution pH, temperature, and
   contact time). The obtained results show that the fast RBBR removal
   (98.8%) can be achieved by loading 25% ZnO nanoparticles into polymeric
   matrix of Cs (Cs-Bz/ZnO-25/Fe3O4), and at optimum adsorption operation
   parameters (adsorbent dosage of 0.04 g, solution of pH 4, temperature of
   60 degrees C, and contact time of 10 min). At these optimum conditions,
   the maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 620.5 mg/g. The best
   isotherm and kinetic models were Freundlich model and
   pseudo-second-order kinetic model, respectively. The probable RBBR dye
   adsorption mechanism can be assigned to various types of physicochemical
   interactions (i.e; electrostatic, n-pi, pi-pi interactions) in addition
   to hydrogen bonding and Yoshida H-bonding. The output of this research
   confirms that Cs-Bz/ZnO-25/Fe3O4 is a superior, recoverable, and
   environment friendly biohybrid nanocomposite adsorbent. The remarkable
   output of this research can open a window for other possible significant
   applications such as tenement of real waste water, removal of heavy
   metal ions, and reduction of chemical oxygen demand.

AB The textile dyeing and printing industries has led to extensive

   microbial species for such application was selected among the isolated
   bacterial populations by conducting CI Reactive Blue 40 (CI RB 40) batch
   degradation studies with the bacterial-algal-probiotic strains. In this
   study, three suitable species (Pseudomonas putida, Chlorella and
   Lactobacillus plantarum) were applied to degrade and detoxify CI RB 40,
   a reactive diazo dye in Real Textile Wastewater, used in textile dyeing
   industry worldwide. Process parameters were optimized using Response
   Surface Methodology and under the optimum conditions (e.g., inoculum
   size of 10%), temperature of 35 150 ppm, and time of 6 days). The
   maximum COD and color removal efficiencies, when tested with 1000 ppm of
   dye using batch reactors were found to be 89% and 99%, respectively. Our
   results showed also that bacteria had a high decolorization capacity.
   The regression analysis revealed a good match of the experimental data
   to the second-order polynomial with a high coefficient of determination
   (R2). UV-Visible and FTIR spectroscopy analysis confirmed the
   biodegradation of CI RB 40. Finally, toxicity of CIRB 40 before and
   after biodegradation was studied and the detoxification of CIRB 40 dye
   solution after biodegradation process was confirmed.

AB Excess chemical and natural fertilizer could create eutrophication of
   surface waters and then depletion of the quality of water. The present
   study aimed to survey the removal efficiency of ammonia from aqueous
   solution using modified clinoptilolite and air stripping process and
   optimization of variables by response surface methodology.
   Clinoptilolite was obtained from Semnan (Northeast of Iran) and modified
   with sodium chloride (to create an adsorbent uniform) and ferric
   chloride (due to three valent of iron) as an efficient and simple
   method. The modified clinoptilolite was characterized by scanning
   electron microscopy, X-ray diffractometer, X-ray fluorescence, and
   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Employing modified
   clinoptilolite as an adsorbent for ammonia removal showed that by
   increasing adsorbent dose, contact time, and pH and decreasing initial
   ammonia concentration, ammonia removal efficiency has been increased. In
   the optimum condition, modified clinoptilolite was able to adsorb
   ammonia as high as 86.04% at an adsorbent dose of 1 g/L, pH of 5, a
   contact time of 3.7 h, and an initial ammonia concentration of 13.27
   mg/L. Also, the sorption capacity of ammonia at the optimum condition of
   air stripping was 96.14%. This process can properly treat the effluent
   of stabilization ponds as real wastewater (about 70% for ammonium
   removal), and the order of reduction effect for cations includes K+ >
   Ca2+ > Na+ > Mg2+, respectively. The findings showed that ammonia
   removal followed the Freundlich isotherm and intraparticle diffusion
   kinetic model. According to the obtained results, as an effective and
   reusable adsorbent, modified clinoptilolite can be appropriately
   employed for ammonia removal from wastewater.

AB Winery wastewaters prove to be an environmental issue due to their
   particular characteristics (high COD and TOC, colour and low pH) as well
   as their seasonal generation. In this work, a new sequential reactor
   design, based on photo electro-Fenton technology combined with LED
   radiation, has been demonstrated as a viable alternative for the
   treatment of these wastewaters. The optimization of the working
   parameters led to achieve high colour and TOC removals in simulated
   effluents with significant initial TOC values. The energy consumption
   was a key factor in these hybrid processes and it was found that the
   process carried out in the new designed reactor was a cost effective
   treatment with around 1 KWh/g(TOCremoved). Finally the validation of the
   designed reactor was successfully performed for the treatment of real

AB In this study, electrochemical oxidation of Bromothymol blue (BTB) was
   studied in an aqueous medium (pH = 3) by electro-Fenton process (EFP).
   This chemical compound belongs to the family of sulfone phthalein,
   widely used for dyeing in the textile industry. EFP generates in a
   catalytic way hydroxyl radicals (. OH) which are powerful oxidant
   species (E-0 (center dot OH/H2O) = 2.8 V/NHE) used for the oxidation of
   organic pollutants. The kinetics of BTB degradation and the
   mineralization efficiency of its process are investigated through the
   effect of some operating parameters. The value of 300 mA as applied
   current, Fe2+ as a catalyst with a concentration of 0.2 mM and a
   temperature of 40 degrees C are found to be the optimum operating
   parameters. The reaction kinetic follows a pseudo-first order with an
   absolute rate constant of 3.36 x 10(10) M(-1)s(-1). The efficiency of
   EFP is confirmed by the decrease of the molecule concentration during
   the treatment until its total disappearing. The chemical oxygen demand
   (COD) analyses indicate after 6 h a mineralization degree of 94% for the
   BTB synthetic solution, 91% for the effluent provided from a small
   Tunisian textile industry and 41% for the wastewater provided from a
   medium one. The energy consumption per unit COD mass (ECCOD) of the EFP
   is determined for the treatment of BTB synthetic solution and for the
   two real effluents. Concerning the BTB synthetic solution, the energetic
   cost is equal to 1.02 kWh (g COD)(-1) at the beginning of the
   electrolysis and it has decreased to reach 0.30 kWh (g COD)(-1) after 6
   h. For the first effluent, the energy consumption rises from 1.20 to
   0.36 kWh (g COD)(-1). An opposite phenomenon is observed for the second
   effluent.

   effluents using analytical-grade magnesium chloride (MCl) with and
   without guar gum (GG) as a coagulant aid and industrial-grade
   polyaluminium chloride (PACl) and aluminum chlorohydrate (ACH) as
   coagulants. A higher decolorization efficiency of 97% at a very high
   dosage of 1800 mg L-1 was observed for MCl. However, considering the
   purity, dosage, decolorization efficiency, and quantity and quality of
   sludge production, ACH was found to be the best coagulant, giving 91%
   decolorization efficiency at a dose of just 100 mg L-1. To achieve this
   high degree of decolorization efficiency, the dosage for PACl was found
   to be approximately 50% higher than that of ACH. Effective
   decolorization (>90%) at a very low dosage (100 mg L-1) and minimal
   quantity of sludge production by ACH demonstrate that ACH is an
   effective coagulant for decolorization of silk dyebath effluents.

   magnesium silicate hydrate (abbreviated as LMSH) nanocomposite hydrogels
   with various clay percentage of LMSH/NIPAm (named as NPX hydrogel) were
   prepared. Adsorption kinetics of NPX samples were investigated under
   different experimental conditions (including solution pH, initial
   concentration of Amaranth dye solution and clay percentage of
   LMSH/NIPAm). Based on the adsorption experiments, adsorption dynamics,
   diffusion mechanisms and adsorption isotherms of NPX samples in Amaranth
   solution were analyzed through pseudo first-order model, pseudo
   second-order model, film diffusion model, intra-particle diffusion model
   and different isotherm models. The adsorption kinetics showed that in
   acidic (pH = 2) Amaranth solution NPX nanocomposite hydrogel was more
   effective for the removal of Amaranth dye. With increasing clay
   percentage of LMSH/NIPAm from 5 to 40 wt.%, adsorption capacity of
   Amaranth dye onto NPX samples decreased due to shrunk pore effect of NPX
   nanocomposite hydrogels and enhanced electrostatic repulsive
   interactions between NPX samples and Amaranth molecules. Adsorption
   dynamics indicated pseudo second-order model was more suitable for the
   investigated adsorption process. The adsorption rate-controlling step
   mainly came from film diffusion, but not the only factor. Adsorption
   isotherm indicated the adsorption process from monolayer adsorption to
   multilayer adsorption. According to Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherm model
   (abbreviated as D-R model), the calculated mean free energy implied
   chemisorption nature between NPX nanocomposite hydrogel and Amaranth.
   Based on adsorption mechanism of NPX nanocomposite hydrogel on Amaranth
   established, the conclusion confirms the prospect of NPX nanocomposite
   hydrogel as effective adsorbent to dispose real dyeing wastewater. (C)

   collected from Jamshoro, Sindh (Pakistan). The resin-encapsulated metal
   oxide nanoparticles showed an excellent performance to reduce MO dye in
   contaminated water. These results approve that the resin-encapsulated
   titanium dioxide nanoparticles (PMBMNOPhenTiO(2)) display a great
   photocatalytic activity for the degradation of MO dye under visible
   light irradiation degradation. Photocatalytic degradation using
   resin-encapsulated (TiO2/SiO2) catalyst is effectively used for the
   textile dye (MO).

AB The use of cheep, non-toxic, safe and easily available adsorbent are
   efficient and recommended material and alternative to the current
   expensive substance for pollutant removal from wastewater. The activated
   carbon prepared from wood waste of local tree (millet) extensively was
   applied for quantitative removal of methylene blue (MB), while simply.
   It was used to re-used after heating and washing with alkaline solution
   of ethanol. This new adsorbent was characterized by using BET surface
   area measurement, FT-IR, pH determination at zero point of charge
   (pH(ZPC)) and Boehm titration method. Response surface methodology (RSM)
   by at least the number of experiments main and interaction of
   experimental conditions such as pH of solution, contact time, initial
   dye concentration and adsorbent dosage was optimized and set as pH 7,
   contact time 18 min, initial dye concentration 20 ppm and 0.2 g of
   adsorbent. It was found that variable such as pH and amount of adsorbent
   as solely or combination effects seriously affect the removal
   percentage. The fitting experimental data with conventional models
   reveal the applicability of isotherm models Langmuir model for their
   well presentation and description and Kinetic real rate of adsorption at
   most conditions efficiently can be represented pseudo-second order, and
   intra-particle diffusion. It novel material is good candidate for
   removal of huge amount of MB (20 ppm) in short time (18 min) by
   consumption of small amount (0.2 g). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Textile industries play an important role in uplifting the national
   economies worldwide. Nevertheless, they generate a huge amount of
   intensive colored effluent, which is a serious threat to the
   environment. The microbial communities present in these highly polluted
   environmental sites help in remediating pollutants naturally. However,
   little is known about their genes and enzymes in the textile wastewater
   systems. In this study, we explored the microbial community structure
   and their functional capability in three different wastewater systems,
   i.e., industry sites, effluent treatment plant (ETP), and common
   effluent treatment plant (CETP). Our findings based on shotgun
   metagenomics highlight the varied bacterial diversity at the three
   industry sites. Overall, the major dominant phyla in the industry site
   and CETP samples were Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, while in the ETP
   site, Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria, and Proteobacteria were predominant.
   The final discharge sample site was having a higher proportion of the
   Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Aeromonas caviae, Desulfovibrio
   desulfuricans, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Shewanella
   decolorationis, Shewanella oneidensis, Shewanella putrefaciens, and
   Vibrio cholera were the abundant species across the three sites.
   Furthermore, this research study identified the key microbial genes
   encoding enzymes having a known role in textile dye and aromatic
   compound degradation. Functional annotation of the shotgun metagenome
   samples indicates the presence of reductase, azoreductase,
   nitrate/nitrite reductase, and oxidoreductase enzyme encoding genes. Our
   findings provide the shotgun metagenomics-based approach for mining the
   textile dye degrading genes and genomic insights into the bioremediation
   of textile industrial effluent.</p>

AB Cardboard factory wastewater is usually known by high chemical oxygen
   demand (COD), color, phenols, lignin, and its derivatives, and usual
   treatment techniques are not able to treat such wastewaters. This study
   aimed to investigate the efficiency of ozone-assisted electrocoagulation
   process (EC/O-3) for the treatment of real cardboard wastewater. The
   parameters influencing COD removal in the EC/O-3 process were optimized
   using response surface methodology. Regard to the statistical model, the
   optimum conditions were obtained at current density 9.6 mA/cm(2), time
   20 min, and pH 12. At optimal condition, EC/O-3 process removed 74.7%
   and 97.5% of COD and color, which was higher compared to ozonation and
   EC processes separately. The COD removal followed pseudo-first-order
   kinetic with the coefficient correlation of 0.97 and the reaction rate
   constant of 0.073 1/min. To sum up, the combined electrocoagulation
   process with ozonation could be used satisfactorily for removing
   pollutants from real cardboard wastewater.

   bioreactors as well. The mixed cultures were immobilized using three
   different biocarriers which were sodium alginate (SA), starch (St), and
   Gelatin (Ge), by the cross-linking with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Results
   revealed that the immobilized cultures had a potential degrading
   efficiency in the anaerobic and aerobic environment, targeting the
   initial structure and the formed compounds, respectively. Complete
   decolourization (100%) of RY15 was observed with a significant chemical
   oxygen demand (COD) removal, which enhanced the subsequent aerobic
   phase. Results demonstrated that COD removals were 92% +/- 6.8, 96% +/-
   3.5, and 100%, using PVA-SA, PVA-St, and PVA-Ge at RY15 initial
   concentrations of 10 mg/L, respectively. The experimental work was
   extended to investigate the dye biodegradation in real textile
   wastewater using mixed cells in immobilized in PVA-SA. The Overloading
   rate (OLR) and Hydraulic retention time (HRT) of the aerobic bioreactor
   are 24.5 mg/L h and 41.37 h, respectively. The experimental profiles of
   RY concentration, COD reduction along with biomass growth, were in good
   agreement with the model predicted profiles. The effectiveness factors
   were 0.96 and 0.99 for the anaerobic and aerobic phases, respectively.

   dye concentration, catalyst concentration, P(3HB) film thickness, and
   fabrication methods of the nanocomposite films were evaluated against
   methylene blue, a standard organic dye. It was observed that 0.4 g of
   P(3HB)-40 wt% TiO2 removed 96% of the color under solar irradiation.
   P(3HB) and TiO2, mixed concurrently in chloroform followed by stirring
   for 24 h showed a more even distribution of the photocatalyst on the
   polymer surface and yielded almost 100% color removal. The
   photocatalytic films were able to completely decolorize real industrial

   reduction of 80%. Reusability of the 0.4 g P(3HB)-40 wt% TiO2 film in
   decolorizing the batik dye wastewater was also possible as it gave a
   high consistent value of decolorization percentage (> 80%) even after
   the sixth repeated usage. Recovery step of the photocatalysts was also
   not required in this simple treatment system. The decolorized batik dye
   wastewater had less/no toxic effects on mosquito larvae, Aedes aegypti,

AB The textile industry generates large amounts of effluents, often treated
   by coagulation/flocculation. The tannin-based coagulants produce a
   high-quality treated effluent and a more biodegradable sludge. Efforts
   have been made to reuse the sludge, however, the synthesis of hydrochars
   and activated hydrochars from this residue was never evaluated before.
   Therefore, this study aimed to produce a novel sludge-based adsorbent,
   through hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) and KHCO3 activation, from real
   laundry wastewater treated with tannin (Tanfloc SG), in order to remove
   methylene blue (MB) from aqueous solutions. Tanfloc SG coagulant was
   more effective to reduce color and turbidity than chemical oxygen
   demand. The best coagulant concentration (140 mg L-1) was selected to
   produce sludge, the hydrochar (HC-S), and activated hydrochar (AHC-S).
   The characterization demonstrated that activation volatilized the
   organic matter, leaving coke and inorganic solids. However, despite the
   lower carbon content, AHC-S presented a notorious surface area (3005.57
   m(2) g(-1)). Minerals were presented in the adsorbents and AHC-S showed
   graphene-like layers. Regarding MB adsorption, pseudo-second-order and
   Langmuir models fitted kinetic and equilibrium data, respectively. HC-S
   and AHC-S obtained q(max )of 69.77 and 808.83 mg g(-1), respectively,
   and the latter was higher than other activated hydrochars, demonstrating
   the potential of the adsorbent.

AB Daily, a big extent of colored, partially treated textile effluents
   drained into the sanitation systems causing serious environmental
   concerns. Therefore, the decolorization treatment process of wastewater
   is crucial to improve effluent quality. In the present study, 3
   different sorbent materials, nano zerovalent iron (nZVI), activated
   carbon (AC), and green-synthesized nano zerovalent iron (GT-nZVI), have
   been prepared for raw textile wastewater decolourization. The prepared
   nanomaterials were characterized via X-ray diffraction (XRD)
   spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive
   X-ray (EDX) analysis, and UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy. In addition,
   the effect of different operating parameters such as pH, contact time,
   and stirring rate on the color removal efficiency was extensively
   studied to identify the optimum removal conditions. The reaction
   temperature, adsorbent dose, and initial color concentration were fixed
   during the experiments at room temperature, 0.7 g/L, and 350 and 50 mg/L
   Pt/Co color unit, respectively. Moreover, adsorption and reaction
   kinetics were analyzed using different isotherms and models. For
   simulating the adsorption process, artificial neural network (ANN) data
   were compatible with the result of regression analysis derived from
   response surface methodology (RSM) optimization. Our results showed the
   higher ability of nZVI, AC, and GT-nZVI in textile wastewater color
   removal. At pH 5, contact time 50 minutes, and stirring rate 150 rpm,
   nZVI showed good color removal efficiency of about 71% and 99% for
   initial color concentrations of 350 and 50 mg/L Pt/Co color unit,
   respectively. While slightly higher color removal ability of about 72%
   and 100% was achieved by using AC at pH 8, contact time 70 minutes, and
   stirring rate 250 rpm. Finally, the largest ability of color removal
   about 85% and 100% was recorded for GT-nZVI at pH 7, contact time 40
   minutes, and stirring rate 150 rpm. This work shows the enhanced color
   removal ability of GT-nZVI as a potential textile wastewater
   decolourization material, opening the way for many industrial and
   environmental applications.

   47.0 mg g(-1)at the temperature of 25 A degrees C at this pH value. The
   Freundlich and Langmuir adsorption models were used for describing the
   adsorption equilibrium data of the dye, and isotherm constants were
   evaluated depending on sorption temperature. Equilibrium data of RTB-G
   133 sorption fitted very well to the Freundlich isotherm. Mass transfer
   and kinetic models were applied to the experimental data to examine the
   mechanisms of adsorption and potential rate-controlling steps. It was
   found that both external mass transfer and intra-particle diffusion
   played an important role in the adsorption mechanisms of dye and
   adsorption kinetics followed the pseudo second-order type kinetic model.
   The thermodynamic analysis indicated that the sorption process was
   exothermic and spontaneous in nature.

AB The photo-assisted electrochemical degradation of a real effluent of the
   atrazine manufacturing process containing atrazine, simazine,
   hydroxy-triazine and propazine was carried out galvanostatically using a
   pilot-scale tubular flow reactor prototype containing DSA((R)) and Ti as
   cathode. The effluent was mainly characterized by a high amount of NaCl,
   required in the synthesis route used, and it was used as taken in the
   factory. The variables for process optimization were the current density
   (3.0, 6.0, and 9.0 mA cm(-2)) and flow rate (300 and 3,000 L h(-1)).
   These later values produces laminar and turbulent flow regimes, with
   Reynolds numbers of 1,100 and 11,000, respectively. None of the four
   organics contained in the waste is refractory to the
   photo-electrochemical treatment and they are depleted with the photo
   electrolytic technology using large current densities and appropriate
   electric charge passed. Both direct electrochemical process and mediated
   anodic oxidation occur during the treatment. First process occurs at
   turbulent flow condition and low current densities, while the chemical
   oxidation process happens at laminar flow condition and high current
   densities. Atrazine and propazine are efficiently removed at laminar
   flow conditions, with an almost total depletion for the largest current
   densities. On the contrary, simazine is efficiently removed in turbulent
   flow conditions and intermediate current density, with removals higher
   than 90% for 20 kWh m(-3). These results have great significance because
   they demonstrate the applicability of the electrochemical technology in
   the treatment of real industrial wastes with a cell specially designed
   to attain high efficiency in the removal of pollutants. (C) 2017

AB In order to apply the photocatalytic processes on a real scale for the
   treatment of industrial wastewaters, the use of slurry reactors
   employing suspended photocatalysts is not suitable due to the need for
   an uncomfortable and expensive separation phase of photocatalyst. To
   overcome this disadvantage, the photocatalyst particles must be
   immobilized on a transparent support: our work proposes, for this
   reason, a simple and cost effective method for the deposition of ZnO
   photocatalyst on glass spheres in order to formulate a structured
   photocatalyst effective in the treatment of aqueous solutions containing
   various organic dyes, commonly used in the tannery industries and in the
   treatment of a real wastewater at high COD content (11 g/L) coming from
   the refining unit of the tanning process. In particular, ZnO was
   immobilized on glass spheres (ZnO/GS) with a simple dip coating method,
   starting from zinc acetate aqueous solution, without using complexing
   agent and strong basic compounds. The optimization of ZnO amount on
   glass spheres was evaluated employing Acid Blue 7 dye, as model
   pollutant. In particular, it was found that best performances in terms
   of discoloration and mineralization of the target dye were obtained
   using the photocatalyst with a ZnO loading equal to 0.19 wt% (ZnO_ac1),
   prepared through only one dip coating step. Moreover, the ZnO_ac1
   photocatalyst can be easily separated from the reaction mixture,
   maintaining excellent photocatalytic activity and durability even after
   several reuse cycles. Finally, ZnO_ac1 showed a high photocatalytic
   activity in the treatment of the real wastewater, obtaining a COD
   removal equal to 70% after 180 min of UV light irradiation. (C) 2018

AB The ecological toxicity imparted by non-biodegradable organic dyes has
   been considered as a major risk to handle in front of mankind. In this
   view, the low-cost zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) were facially
   synthesized by coating the surface with surfactant (CTAB) and ionic
   liquid (BMTF) molecules for the effective removal of Eriochrome Black T
   (EBT) from aqueous media. Various advanced characterization techniques
   have given insight into the morphological features, crystalline
   structure and physio-chemical properties of as-synthesized ZnO-NPs. The
   systematic analysis of the adsorption isotherms and kinetics models
   specifies that the adsorption of EBT follow Freundlich model and
   pseudo-second-order kinetics. The intraparticle diffusion model
   displayed a linear relationship (R-2 = 0.98, 0.97 and 0.94 for BMTF@ZnO,
   CTAB@ZnO and bare ZnO-NPs), which shows that pore diffusion rate is
   affected by surface modification and effects the overall EBT adsorption
   process. Furthermore, after the removal of 87% and 84% of EBT dye by
   BMTF@ZnO-NPs and CTAB@ZnO-NPs, the fabricated nanoadsorbents of ZnO were
   successfully regenerated and reused after the treatments up to four
   times. The adsorption aptitude of ZnO-NPs towards EBT dye was
   systematically explored in real wastewater samples and interference
   study of inorganic metallic salts was also performed. The toxicity
   estimations of the treated dye solutions were made using floral and
   fungal activities, to ascertain their non-toxic nature before releasing
   into the environment. These outcomes have supported the immense
   potential of ZnO-NPs towards the removal of EBT in a cost effective
   manner. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the present study, bubbling reactors (BRs) were chosen to design a
   new procedure for real industrial wastewater (WW) treatment by Fenton's
   oxidation. The process was carried out in BRs under batch mode for the
   treatment of a WW with a high organic load (chemical oxygen demand (COD)
   above 7000 mgO(2)/L), being the efficient mixing of the liquid phase
   ensured by the gas bubbling. The parameters that influenced the WW
   treatment (i.e., H2O2 and Fe2+ concentration, and initial pH) were
   optimized in a smaller BR (0.5 L volumetric capacity); the maximum
   oxidation efficiency (dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal = 52% and
   COD removal = 83% after 60 min) was reached under the following
   conditions: Q(air )= 1.0 L/min (measured at room temperature and
   atmospheric pressure), [H2O2] = 22.5 g/L, [Fe2+] = 0.75 g/L, and pH =
   4.6 - original WW pH. It was not detected any significant effect in the
   process efficiency of the air flow rate and gas phase composition (i.
   e., N-2, and air), but when the process was performed with continuous
   O-2 bubbling an increase in the DOC removal (from 43% to 53%) was
   observed after 5 min of oxidation. Even so, the high costs discourage
   the use of pure oxygen streams in real WWTPs. To understand the dynamics
   of the process, the continuous air bubbling was compared to another
   mixing mode (mechanical stirring), and similar mineralization was
   achieved, proving the feasibility of Fenton's process in a BR. In
   addition, the gas bubbling proved to be more efficient in terms of heat
   dissipation during the treatment, decreasing temperature profiles along
   the oxidation of heavily charged real effluents. An effective scale-up
   with a bubble column reactor with a higher volumetric capacity by a
   factor of almost one order of magnitude was also proved, providing
   similar mineralization. The final effluent was nontoxic and more
   biodegradable.

AB A molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) was developed for the
   determination of acid violet 19 (AV19) dye. The MIP was synthesized by
   polymerization using 1-vinyl imidazole (functional monomer) and
   2,2'-azobis(2-methylpropionitrile) as the radical initiator. The
   functional monomer was previously selected by computational simulations.
   The MIP adsorption data could be fitted using the Langmuir model
   obtained a Q(m) value of 6.93 mg g(-1) and 2.84 mg g(-1) for the
   corresponding non-imprinted polymer (NIP) and the process followed
   pseudo-second-order kinetics (k(2) 0.2416 mg g(-1) min(-1) MIP). The BET
   specific surface areas were 229.6 m(2) g(-1) and 28.6 m(2) g(-1), to MIP
   and NIP, respectively. Analyses showed that the material provided
   excellent selectivity towards acid violet 19 (AV19) when compared to
   other analytes including Acid Violet 17 (AV17), Tartrazine (TZ), Acid
   Red 14 (AR14), Patent blue-VF (PBV), Sunset yellow FCF (SY) and Acid Red
   1 (AR1). The calculated K-d value for the MIP was 0.116 L g(-1) and the
   imprinting factor was 2.89. This alternative and effective material for
   the enrichment, extraction, and determination of acid violet 19 presents
   in complex real samples was applied using two different rivers water and
   industrial effluent, with excellent recoveries values ranging between
   85% up to 99%.

AB In this study, the treatability of real textile wastewater [dissolved

   was investigated in sequential anaerobic moving bed bioreactor (AnMBBR)
   and aerobic membrane bioreactor (AeMBR). AnMBBR was filled with 40 %
   career material (Kaldnes K1). The effect of different hydraulic
   retention times (HRTs) (6-48 h) and powdered activated carbon (PAC)
   addition (1 g/L) was investigated for system optimization. Sequential
   AnMBBR- AeMBR was successfully operated for textile wastewater treatment
   corresponding to 92 %, and 90 % dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and color
   removals, respectively. The effluent quality, dropped under 45 Pt-Co and
   18 mg/L effluent values, was relatively high and complianted with
   discharge standards. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR)
   analysis showed that primary amines are successfully removed in AeMBR
   effluent. Fouling in AeMBR was increased when HRT was reduced, however,
   improved by 90 % at PAC addition conditions. Except for soluble
   microbial products (SMP) and soluble extracellular polymeric substances
   (EPS), it was observed that silicon (Si) (13.16 %) has an important role
   in fouling which was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and
   Energy-Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. Additionally, microbial
   community structures indicated that the membrane fouling can be caused
   by Alphaproteobacteria (80 %) which was the dominant culture in the
   biofilm layer at a maximum fouling rate.

AB This study focuses on improving the effectiveness of activated carbon
   (AC) by two-stage batch adsorbing application and calculation of the
   multi-stage batch adsorption limitation which were compared with the
   data from experiments. Firstly, the isotherms of methylene blue (MB)
   adsorption onto AC were presented at 293, 303 and 313 K. Langmuir and
   Temkin models were performed to obtain the minimal error of fitting. The
   two-stage batch adsorption model was designed to promote the removal
   efficiency in fixed adsorbent consumption by a series of functional
   relation derivation from the isotherm function and mass conservation.
   For further discussing the situation of more than two adsorption stage,
   the multi-stage batch adsorption model was developed from two-stage by
   adsorbent mass approximating treatment and integrating all the
   single-stage adsorption processes. The results indicated that the
   increase of removal efficiency from the two-stage batch adsorption got
   to 5.2% higher, comparing the single-stage batch adsorption process in
   the initial conditions of 10 mL 500 mg/L MB solution and 10 mg adsorbent
   mass. Secondly, according to the two-stage batch mode, a series of
   verified experiments were operated under the same circumstance and the
   real experimental consequences revealed its validity and reliability.
   Meanwhile, for achieving the fixed removal efficiency, a series of
   adsorption simulations were calculated according to the two-stage batch
   adsorption which showed almost 30% amount of adsorbent was saved for 99%
   removal efficiency arrival. In addition, the efficient comparison among
   single, two and multi-stage batch adsorption and economic, practical
   values of two-stage were further demonstrated.

AB A fuzzy logic-based diagnosis system was developed to optimize the

   A batch-scale colour removal experiment was conducted with a set of
   variable parameters of the process. The measured data of variables were
   implemented into the fuzzy inference system with Mamdani's method. The
   fuzzy model incorporates the weights provided by an expert, avoids the
   crisp values and offers overlapping range between the different fuzzy
   sets. A fuzzy rule-based model was shaped to define essential quality
   parameters monitored as pH, temperature, inoculum concentrations and
   glucose concentration as inputs. The fuzzy-modelled values of
   decolourization were validated against the experimental values. Results
   suggested that modelled results could be validated with experimental
   data-sets, as supported by a significant correlation coefficient
   (r=0.87). This study confirms the applicability of fuzzy logic for
   optimization of conditions in the decolourization process in textile

AB In the past decade, thanks to their ultrafast water transport and
   excellent molecule sieving properties, researches on graphene oxide (GO)
   based membranes have developed rapidly. However, the researches were
   mainly conducted in laboratory scale, and so far, there is no real
   on-site wastewater treatment experiments using GO-based membranes in
   pilot-scale reported. Herein, we report an on-site pilot trial study
   using the ultrathin GO membrane to treat a dyehouse effluent. The
   performance of the GO membrane was studied to provide insight for the
   large-scale applications. A long-term pilot trial of 45 days was
   conducted to investigate the long-term stability of the GO membrane. The
   rejection of mixed salts in the dyehouse effluent can be maintained at
   about 77.0%. And most typical organic pollutants in the effluent can be
   effectively removed. The quality of the produced water fully meets the
   requirements of the Chinese Industry Standard FZ/T 01107-2011. The
   results showed that the GO membrane has excellent purification
   efficiency for the real dyehouse effluent and excellent stability during
   the long-term trial run. The pilot scale study suggests that the GO
   membrane is highly feasible to treat the dyehouse effluent in a large
   industrial scale.

AB In this work, an humic acid adsorption with an enhanced Fenton oxidation
   was employed to treat the real effluent originating from the
   1-diazo-2-naphthol-4-sulfonic acid (1.2,4-Acid) production plant. In a
   first step, humic acid with MgSO4 was selected as adsorbent and
   precipitant for physicochemical pretreatment, the synergetic effect had
   led to 39% of COD removal and 89% of colour removal. A multi-staged
   Fenton oxidation process with inner circulation was introduced
   subsequently. The TOC, COD, 1,2,4-Acid, NH4.-N, SS and colour were
   reduced from 3024 mg/L, 12,780 mg/L, 9103 mg/L, 110 mg/L, 240 mg/L and
   25,600 (multiple) to 46 mg/L, 210 mg/L, 21 mg/L, 16 mg/L. 3 mg/L and 25
   through the combined process, respectively. Hydrogen peroxide consumed
   per kg COD had saved up to 36% when two-staged Fenton process with inner
   circulation (flow-back to influent ratio: 3) was applied. Influence of
   H2O2 concentration, flow-back to influent ratio and staged Fenton mode
   were investigated in detail in order to find out the optimal operating
   parameters. The kinetics of 1,2,4-Acid degradation by two-staged Fenton
   process was investigated. The evolution of the main intermediates during
   the degradation process was conducted using the LC-(ESI)-TOF-MS
   technique, and the results showed a staged degradation pathway from the
   ring opening of naphthalene compounds to the formation of benzene
   compounds and carboxyl acids. The combined process had been proved
   effective in both technical and economic aspects. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

   transition metal dosage enhanced efficiency of electro-Fenton process
   significantly. The BOD5/COD value of textile wastewater increased from
   0.127 to 0.156, 0.38 and 0.453, after electrogenerated hydrogen peroxide
   with anodic oxidation and electro-Fenton processes conducted with Cu2+
   and Fe2+ respectively. Therefore, biodegradability was significantly
   enhanced in presence of catalysts (Fe2+ and Cu-2+), particularly in
   presence of Fe2+ which was superior to Cu2+. It is also concluded that
   the electro-Fenton process is an effective technology for the colored
   wastewater treatment and it can be a pretreatment before biological
   processes.

AB Herein, a simpler-viable methodology for the surface decoration of pear
   fruit derived graphene aerogel (GA) via cadmium sulfide (CdS) has been
   presented. GA can be easily synthesized from bio-mass, which provide an
   economic advantage. Surface decoration via CdS imparts photocatalytic
   activities in functionalized graphene aerogels (f-GA). CdS-f-GA is being
   explored here as a photocatalyst for the degradation of a toxic azo dye
   named Congo red in the presence of sunlight. The rate and mechanism
   associated with photodegradation were analyzed by performing kinetics
   and radical trap-based quenching experiments. Nuclear magnetic resonance
   and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses of the control and
   photodegraded products were performed to ensure the degradation of the
   organic framework of Congo red. Additionally, the real-life
   applicability of CdS-f-GA was also analyzed by degrading the dye in
   different types of industrial samples (via the method of external
   spiking), which can advance its practical relevance.

   aeruginosaZM130, was tested to explore its potential for the treatment
   of synthetic and real textile wastewaters in aerobic and anaerobic
   bench-scale sequencing batch bioreactors (SBRs) as well as in
   constructed soil columns. The decolorizing ability of strain ZM130
   against reactive black-5 (RB5) was optimized following a response
   surface methodology (RSM)-based approach, and this strain was observed
   to effectively decolorize RB5 even in presence of a substantial quantity
   of NaCl salt along multi-metal mixture including Cr6+, Pb2+, Cd2+, and
   Zn2+. In the SBR containing the immobilized cells of the strain ZM130,
   more than 80% of the RB5, hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)], and chemical
   oxygen demand (COD) were removed from the textile wastewater under
   partially anaerobic condition using yeast extract as an additional
   carbon co-substrate. Furthermore, while studying the bioremediating
   ability of strain ZM130 in constructed soil columns, the maximum color
   removal (> 90%), Cr(VI) removal (> 95%), and COD removal (> 90%) were
   achieved in the soil columns bioaugmented with ZM130 together with
   either sludge or yeast extract. Interestingly, it was further noticed
   that soil columns augmented withP. aeruginosaZM130 also showed maximum
   color removal from real textile wastewater in vertical columns filled
   with sterilized (> 87%) and non-sterilized soil (> 91%). Based on the
   results of the present research work, it can be concluded thatP.
   aeruginosaZM130 can serve as an excellent potential candidate for
   treatment of textile wastewaters in bioreactors as well as in soils.

AB Heavy metal and ionic dyes commonly co-exist and constitute the most
   important and dangerous source of environmental pollution. Graphene
   oxide has the potential in the application to remove heavy metal ions
   and ionic dyes in wastewater, but it suffers from separation
   inconvenience. In this paper, magnetic graphene oxide (MGO) was
   synthesized and used as an adsorbent for simultaneous removal of Cd(II)
   and ionic dyes including methylene blue (MB) and orange G (OG). MGO
   adsorbent was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results showed that kinetic
   data followed a pseudo-second-order model and equilibrium data were well
   fitted by the Langmuir model. In mono-component system, the maximum
   sorption capacities in ultrapure water for Cd(II), MB and OG were 91.29
   mg/g, 64.23 mg/g and 20.85 mg/g, respectively. The sorption capacity
   suppressed for Cd(II) with increasing MB concentration and almost was
   not affected for MB with increasing Cd(II) concentration in Cd(II)-MB
   binary system. However, the sorption capacity enhanced for OG with
   increasing Cd(II) concentration and for Cd(II) was independent on the
   concentration of OG in Cd(II)-OG binary system. In tap water samples,
   the sorption capacity for Cd(II) was 65.39% of that in ultrapure water.
   However, the tap water samples had little interference with the
   performance of MGO toward MB and OG, indicating that MGO was suitable
   for removal of ionic dyes from real water. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

AB This study aims to propose combined techniques for electrodegradation
   and adsorption using graphene oxide/alginate (GO/Alg) as an alternative
   method to enhance the removal of dyes from wastewater. Therefore, GO/Alg
   was newly synthesized and designed with an electrochemical cell.
   Methylene blue (MB), as a cationic dye commonly used by textile
   industries, was used as a model dye for evaluating the developed system.
   All the related experimental parameters were well optimized for the
   optimum efficiency of the proposed system. The composition of GO/Alg,
   concentration of CaCl2, and pH solution have been investigated. The
   GO/Alg was characterized by XRD (X-Ray Diffraction), FTIR (Fourier
   Transform Infra Red), a SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope), TEM
   (Transmission Electron Microscope), and an SAA (Surface Area Analyzer).
   The characterizations presented that GO was well exfoliated in the
   alginate matrix. The optimum condition for removing MB dye was found to
   be pH 3.0, for 30 min at a voltage of 4.5 V with the first order rate
   constant (k) 7.45x10(-2) min(-1). In addition, the combined technique
   showed good removal efficiency in the simulated real textile sample with
   a percentage of = 90%. This work proves that the electro-adsorption
   technique is more efficient than adsorption as a single technique.

AB The dyeing wastewater treatment under increasing high temperature
   condition was studied in MBBRs. Results showed that as the temperature
   increase, the COD removal exhibited two best performances at 40 degrees
   C and 50 degrees C, and the maximum NH3-N removal was obtained at 35
   degrees C and 40 degrees C The optimum temperature for extracellular
   polymeric substances (EPS) yield is 45 degrees C and the humic acid was
   the major contributor. Microbial community was analyzed by the
   association of DGGE, real-time PCR and high-throughput sequencing
   technologies. The highest abundance of AOB (characterized by amoA genes)
   was obtained at 35 degrees C, and it confirmed that the biofilm
   (attached on fillers) can facilitate the AOB abundance maintaining in
   the sludge. The "precursor and successor" thermophilic communities were
   enriched and dominant at different temperature stages, which mainly
   conclude genera Caldilinea (from 35 degrees C to 45 degrees C) and
   genera Rubellimicrobium and Pseudoxanthomonas (over 50 degrees C),
   respectively. It meant the thermophilic community displayed great
   evolution at the critical temperature "45 degrees C vertical bar 50
   degrees C". Additionally, the process of thermotolerant mechanism
   establishment of the sludge in the MBBRs is proposed and the "two-stage
   enrichment" of different thermophilic communities was considered as the
   key procedure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, activated carbon (AC) coated with a green silicone
   surfactant (SS) was further incorporated with magnetite particles
   (Fe3O4) via a co-precipitation method to enhance the separation of the
   newly designed magnetic AC-SS (Fe3O4@AC-SS) in a magnetic field. The
   properties of this magnetic adsorbent were characterized via Fourier
   transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetric analysis
   (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and transmission electron microscopy
   (TEM). The adsorption characteristics of the Fe3O4@AC-SS adsorbent were
   examined using 2,4-nitrophenol and 2,4-dichlorophenol as adsorbates.
   Experiments were performed to investigate the adsorption kinetics,
   isotherms, thermodynamics as well as the effects of adsorption dosage
   and solution pH on the removal of both analytes. The kinetic data were
   well-fitted by the pseudo-second order model and the Freundlich model
   best described the adsorption isotherm for both analytes. The maximum
   adsorption capabilities for 2,4-dinitrophenol and 2,4-dichlorophenol
   reached 43 and 98 mg g(-1), respectively. The analysis was further
   validated using real industrial effluent, and a removal efficiency of
   62.2-98.1% and relative standard deviation value less than 7.2% were
   attained for both analytes. Thus, the multifunctional adsorbent has
   potential to function as an adsorbent for the fast, convenient,
   economical and highly efficient removal of pollutants from wastewater,
   which is significant for the purification of natural water and
   industrial effluent.

   iron sulphate, and then characterized by N-2 and CO2
   adsorption-desorption experiments and scanning electron microscopy
   coupled to energy dispersive spectroscopy. The presence of iron-based
   nanoparticles highly dispersed in the porosity was demonstrated and the
   nanoparticles were identified as wustite (FeO) by X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy. The performances of this catalyst were investigated for
   the treatment of actual textile wastewater from Bamako handicraft
   loincloths dyeing by the heterogeneous Fenton process. The response
   surface methodology was used to optimize the effects of three
   independent parameters (catalyst dose, H2O2 concentration, and initial
   total organic carbon (TOC) concentration) on the efficiency of
   wastewater treatment assessed by the rate of TOC reduction. The optimal
   conditions are found for 2 g/L catalyst, 16.73 mmol/L H2O2 and 99.83
   mg/L initial TOC corresponding to a prediction of 90.2% reduction of
   TOC. In these experimental conditions, the measured rate of degradation
   of 90.4% is in agreement with the proposed model. This high level of
   mineralization demonstrates that the Fenton process using the prepared
   catalyst is a viable treatment for the waste water from Bamako
   handicraft textile dyeing.

   nanofiber/graphene oxide polymer aerogel (MBCNF/GOPA) composed of
   bacterial cellulose nanofibers (BCNFs), Fe3O4 nanoparticles, graphene
   oxide (GO) nano-sheets, and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was developed by
   combining a facile filler-loaded networks method with a vacuum
   freeze-drying process for the removal of malachite green (MG) dye from
   aqueous solution. The influence of various factors on adsorption,
   including initial dye concentration, adsorbent dosage, contact time,
   temperature, and pH of dye solution, was then investigated. The
   adsorbent preserved a high adsorption capacity over a wide range of pH
   conditions. Moreover, the adsorption isotherms data fitted well with the
   Langmuir isotherm model with a maximum adsorption capacity of 270.27 mg
   g(-1). Adsorption kinetics followed the pseudo-second-order model, and
   the thermodynamic parameters showed that the adsorption of MG dye was
   feasible and endothermic in nature and occurred spontaneously.
   Therefore, owing to its demonstrated properties such as 3D
   interconnected porous structure, lightweight, large specific surface
   area, superparamagnetic behavior at room temperature, excellent
   adsorbent efficiency (93% removal) and also its simple and eco-friendly
   synthesis process, MBCNF/GOPA could be considered a promising candidate
   for removing cationic dye pollutants from aqueous solution, which can
   easily be collected from aqueous solution by a small magnet. MBCNF/GOPA
   also showed favorable reusability for MG removal in wastewater
   treatment, and its application in different water samples for the
   removal of MG dye molecules from "real" samples was successfully
   performed.

   general information about the textile industry and treatment techniques
   are mentioned, as well as the properties of ceramic membranes and
   textile wastewater treatment. In the literature review made in this
   study, recent studies on the production of ceramic membranes and

AB Electro-oxidation is a promising technology for wastewater treatment
   with biorefractory organic and nitrogen pollutants; however, the high
   energy demand hinders its wide application. In this study, a novel
   method by regulating significant parameter during the electro-oxidation
   process in a timely manner for real dyeing wastewater treatment with
   energy savings was studied. Operating factors (i.e., flow rate, initial
   pH value, electrode distance, and current density) were investigated for
   chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia removal, and the results
   indicated that current density was the key factor that obviously
   influenced the electrochemical performance. Indirect oxidation by active
   chlorine was then confirmed as the main reaction pathway for pollutant
   oxidation, and the relationship between the current density and the
   generation of active chlorine was established, suggesting that a large
   part of the generated active chlorine was not utilized effectively.
   Subsequently, a novel method of varying the current density in a timely
   manner based on the reaction mechanism was proposed; the results
   indicated that, with similar pollutant removal efficiencies, energy
   consumption could be reduced from 31.6 to 20.5 kWh/m(3). Additionally,
   the novel system was further optimized by Box-Behnken design: The COD
   removal efficiency could reach 71.8%, and the energy demand could be
   reduced by 45.6%.

AB Hospitals consume a large volume of water to carry out their activities
   and, hence, generate a large volume of effluent that is commonly
   discharged into the local sewage system without any treatment. Among the
   various sectors of healthcare facilities, the laundry is responsible for
   the majority of water consumption and generates a highly complex
   effluent. Although several advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are
   currently under investigation on the degradation of a variety of
   contaminants, few of them are based on real wastewater samples. In this
   paper, the UV/H2O2 AOP was evaluated on the treatment of a hospital
   laundry wastewater, after the application of a physicochemical
   pretreatment composed of coagulation-flocculation and anthracite
   filtration. For the UV/H2O2 process, a photoreactor equipped with a
   low-pressure UV-C lamp was used and the effects of initial pH and
   [H2O2]/chemical oxygen demand (COD) ratio on COD removal were
   investigated through a randomized factorial block design that considered
   the batches of effluent as blocks. The results indicated that the
   initial pH had no significant effect on the COD removal, and the process
   was favored by the increase in [H2O2]/COD ratio. Color and turbidity
   were satisfactorily reduced after the application of the physicochemical
   pretreatment, and COD was completely removed by the UV/H2O2 process
   under suitable conditions. The results of this study show that the
   UV/H2O2 AOP is a promising candidate for hospital laundry wastewater
   treatment and should be explored to enable wastewater reuse in the
   washing process.

AB Proposed and studied in the mid-1960s, water-insoluble
   cyclodextrin-epichlorohydrin polymers are of constant interest to the
   scientific community, particularly for their environmental applications.
   The unique feature of these materials is their ability to form inclusion
   complexes with various pollutants through host-guest interactions. This
   leads to many environmental applications including water and wastewater
   treatment, soil remediation, air purification and the concentration or
   elimination of target substances such as cholesterol. In the early
   1990s, our group began working on the synthesis of water-insoluble
   cyclodextrin-based materials, their structural characterization and
   their application in the removal of pollutants present in wastewater.
   Here I summarizes the research conducted over the past 30 years by our
   group on water-insoluble cyclodextrin-epichlorohydrin polymers used as
   complexing materials to remove pollutants present in aqueous solutions.
   Our major findings are: (i) the synthesis of a series of water-insoluble
   materials with different functionalities in the form of gels or beads;
   (ii) their characterization by innovative solid-state NMR techniques;
   (iii) the demonstration of their efficiency as adsorbents in wastewater
   treatment and the explanation of the pollutant removal mechanisms
   according to the type of material used; (iv) the demonstration of a
   correlation between the structure of polymers and their adsorption
   properties; (v) the feasibility of the materials for the removal of
   pollutants as a tertiary treatment of wastewater in pilot-scale
   experiments using real effluents; and (vi) the use for the first time of
   bioassays based on lettuce seed germination to evaluate the usefulness
   of the process.

AB Bacterial biosorption can be used for the removal of pollutants from
   waters contaminated with pollutants that are not easily biodegradable,
   such as metals and dyes. A variety of biomaterials are known to bind
   these pollutants including bacteria, fungi, algae, and certain
   industrial and agricultural wastes. Biosorbents are less costly and more
   effective alternatives for the removal of metallic elements, especially
   heavy metals, from aqueous solution. In this chapter, the sorption
   abilities of bacterial biomass toward metal ions are emphasized. The
   appropriate conditions for immobilizing bacteria for maximum biosorption
   and the mechanism(s) involved are highlighted. The properties of cell
   wall constituents, such as peptidoglycan, and the role of functional
   groups, such as carboxyl, amine, and phosphonate, are discussed on the
   basis of their biosorption potentials. Binding mechanisms as well as the
   parameters influencing passive uptake of pollutants are analyzed. A
   detailed description of isotherm and kinetic models and the importance
   of mechanistic modeling are presented. To enhance biosorption capacity,
   biomass modifications through chemical methods and genetic engineering
   are needed for the effective removal of metal. For continuous treatment
   of effluents, a packed column configuration is suggested and the factors
   influencing its performance are discussed. The chapter also highlights
   the necessity for examination of biosorbents within real-world
   situations, as competition between solutes and water quality may affect
   biosorption performance. Thus, this chapter reviews the achievements and
   current status of biosorption technology and provides insights into this
   research frontier.

AB In this work photodegradation rates and pathways of malachite green were
   studied under simulated and solar irradiation with the goal of assessing
   the potential of photolysis as a removal mechanism in real aquatic
   environment. Factors influencing the photodegradation process were
   investigated, including pH, humic acid, Fe2+, Ca2+, HCO3-, and NO3-, of
   which favorable conditions were optimized by the orthogonal array design
   under simulated sunlight irradiation in the presence of dissolved
   oxygen. The degradation processes of malachite green conformed to pseudo
   first-order kinetics and their degradation rate constants were between
   0.0062 and 0.4012 h(-1). Under solar irradiation, the decolorization
   efficiency of most tests can reach almost 100%, and relatively thorough
   mineralization could be observed. Forty degradation products were
   detected by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and thirteen small
   molecular products were identified by gas chromatography-mass
   spectrometry. Based on the analyses of the degradation products and
   calculation of the frontier electron density, the pathways were
   proposed: decomposition of conjugated structure, N-demethylation
   reactions, hydroxyl addition reactions, the removal of benzene ring, and
   the ring-opening reaction. This study has provided a reference, both for
   photodegradation of malachite green and future safety applications and
   predictions of decontamination of related triphenylmethane dyes under
   real conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   cycles only nanofiltration membrane was used. All samples were subjected
   to chemical oxygen demand, total hardness, total organic carbon, color
   and conductivity tests. Flux and temperature were also monitored
   throughout operations. According to obtained results, for
   ultrafiltration thorn nanofiltration cycles overall average removal
   efficiencies are 89%, 83.5%, 86.4% and 68% for chemical oxygen demand,

   82.2%, 76.8% and 82% for chemical oxygen demand, color, total organic
   carbon and total hardness, respectively. Besides, treated wastewater was
   tested whether it is suitable for dyeing processes or not. And according
   to temperature difference between inlet and outlet streams, it can be
   said that it is feasible to use ceramic membrane technology for hot

AB MnP-YC4, a newly constructed manganese peroxidase-producing yeast
   consortium, has been developed to withstand lignin degradation
   inhibitors while degrading and detoxifying azo dye. MnP-YC4 tolerance to
   major biomass-derived inhibitors was promising. MnP induced by lignin
   was found to be highly related to dye decolorization by MnP-YC4.
   Simulated azo dye-containing wastewater supplemented with a lignin
   co-substrate (3,5-Dimethoxy-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde) decolorized up to
   100, 91, and 76% at final concentrations of 20, 40, and 60%,
   respectively. MnP-YC4 effectively decolorized the real textile
   wastewater sample, reaching up to 91.4%, and the COD value decreased
   significantly during the decolorization, reaching 7160 mg/l within 7
   days. A possible dye biodegradation pathway was proposed based on the
   degradation products identified by UV-vis, FTIR, GC/MS, and HPLC
   techniques, beginning with azo bond cleavage and eventually mineralized
   to CO2 and H2O. When compared to the phytotoxic original dye, the
   phytotoxicity of MnP-YC4 treated dye-containing wastewater samples
   confirmed the nontoxic nature.

AB Removal of two widely used antibiotics, flumequine (FLU) and
   ciprofloxacin (CIP), in synthetic and real hospital wastewaters was
   investigated using Fe-doped zinc oxide (Fe-ZnO) and UV-A irradiation.
   Fe-ZnO was supported on a cellulose acetate membrane and integrated in a
   recirculation reactor system, designed for continuous oxidative
   treatment of contaminated wastewaters. Addition of a low concentration
   of persulfate (e.g. 0.5 mM) improved considerably the degradation
   extent, where sulfate radicals were found to be the most involved
   oxidizing species. Oxidation rate constants decreased in mixture systems
   with respect to those of individual compounds, because of competition
   effects with radical species. Wastewater constituents like those found
   in hospital effluents affected the removal of both CIP and FLU, but CIP
   degradation is less affected probably because of its higher reactivity
   with sulfate radicals. Inorganic anions altered slightly the oxidation
   rate, while the organic compounds commonly found in wastewaters
   considerably reduced the degradation efficiency. ZnO doped with Fe
   exhibited photoactivity higher than bare zinc oxide and commercial TiO2,
   especially in hospital wastewater. The Fe-ZnO supported membrane can
   also be re-used for several oxidation runs, making this system quite
   suitable for larger applications in wastewater treatment processes.

AB Oxidation of anthraquinonic dye Acid Blue 62 by electrolysis with
   conductive-diamond electrodes is studied in this work. COD, TOC, and
   color have been selected to monitor the degradation of the molecule as a
   function of several operating inputs (current density, pH, temperature,
   and NaCl concentration). Results show that the electrochemical oxidation
   of this model of large molecules follows a first order kinetics in all
   the conditions assessed, and it does not depend on the pH and
   temperature. The occurrence of chloride ions in wastewaters increases
   the rate of color and COD removal as a consequence of the mediated
   oxidation promoted by the chlorinated oxidizing species. However,
   chloride occurrence does not have an influence on the mineralization
   rate. First-order kinetic-constants for color depletion (attack to
   chromophores groups), oxidation (COD removal), and mineralization (TOC
   removal) were found to depend on the current density and to increase
   significantly with its value. A single model was proposed to explain
   these changes in terms of the mediated oxidation processes. Rate of
   mineralization remained very close to that expected for a purely mass
   transfer-controlled process. This was explained assuming that mediated
   oxidation does not have a significant influence on the mineralization in
   spite it has some effect on intermediate oxidation stages. The
   efficiency of the oxidation was found to depend mainly on the
   concentration of COD being negligible the effect of the other inputs
   assessed except for the occurrence of chloride ions. Opposite, the
   efficiency of mineralization depends on concentration of TOC and current
   density and it did not depend on the chloride occurrence. This
   observation was found to have an important influence on the power
   required to remove a given percentage of the initial TOC or COD. To
   decrease COD efficiently, the occurrence of chloride in the solution is
   very important, while to remove TOC efficiently, it is more important to
   work at low current densities and chloride effect is negligible. Energy
   consumption could be decreased by folds using the proper conditions.

   decreased with the electrolysis time. In contrast, slight change of
   absorption of EG (at 322nm) indicated that EG was not destroyed in the
   electrolytic process. The variation of color removal efficiency with
   dosage of chitosan/Fe3O4 nanoparticles, applied voltage, concentration
   of electrolyte, pH and electrolytic time were investigated. The max
   color removal efficiency was 87.24%. PET fabrics were depolymerized by
   using the decolorized waste liquid or mixture of decolorized waste
   liquid and EG (1:1 v/v), and the yields of BHET were 72.3% and 76.6%,
   respectively. The products were BHET without dyes which were confirmed

AB Mixed printing and dyeing wastewater (MPDW) is characterized by a

   a high fraction of recalcitrant components, a low COD/SO42- ratio
   (approximately 1.0), and a high pH (about 8-10 without adjustment). In
   this study, a biological system that combined a hybrid anaerobic baffled
   reactor (HABR) and a cross flow aerobic sludge reactor (CFASR) was
   successfully used to treat MPDW that was discharged from an industrial
   zone. The HABR-CFASR system was fed with real MPDW. In the start-up
   stage, the system had low organic loading rates of 0.66 and 0.45 kg
   COD/(m(3)center dot d) for the HABR and CFASR, respectively. These
   increased to 2.03 and 1.00 kgCOD/(m(3)center dot d), respectively, in
   the steady stage. The pH of the HABR influent was reduced by adding
   H2SO4 at a decreased dosage over the course of the experiment. Most of
   the final effluent from the combined treatment process was stable below
   100 mg-COD/L and 20 mg-BOD/L after 12 h-HRT in the HABR followed by 20 h
   in the CFASR. The sulfate removal rate reached 17.59%, and the COD/SO42-
   ratio varied slightly around 1.0, regardless of the Ns (sulfate loading
   rate), which varied between 1.5 and 2.5 kgSO(4)(2-) /(m(3)center dot d).
   A GC/MS analysis demonstrated that the amount and types of organic
   compounds declined significantly after the HABR treatment.

   optimum conditions. Under these conditions 42.5% TOC, 18.6% chemical
   oxygen demand (COD), 83.5% turbidity, 64.7% of the total suspended

AB In this study, iron oxide nanoparticles (IO-NPs) with a mean diameter of
   102.85 nm were firstly synthesized via a facile green route using Ulva
   spp. aqueous extract as a bioreductant agent. Then, IO-NPs were loaded
   into carbonated hydroxyapatite (c-Hap) and the final product was named
   as the iron oxide nanoparticles loaded carbonated hydroxyapatite
   (IO-NPs-Lc-Hap). Subsequently, IO-NPs-Lc-Hap was characterized by FT-IR,
   SEM, XRD and EDX analysis methods. MG colour removal efficiencies of
   Ulva spp., Hap, IO-NPs and IO-NPs-Lc-Hap materials were also evaluated
   by adsorption and/or Fenton-like reaction methods. IO-NPs-Lc-Hap with
   the highest decolourization capacity was chosen as a heterogeneous
   Fenton-like catalyst for Malachite Green (MG). For Fenton-like
   decolourization of MG, the optimum H2O2 concentration, initial dye
   concentration and catalyst concentration were determined to be 30 mM,
   100 mg/L and 1.0 g/L, respectively. At these optimum conditions, 100%
   decolourization efficiency and 33.3% COD removal were obtained. On the
   other hand, 94% decolourization efficiency and 42% COD removal were
   achieved for the real textile wastewater at the obtained optimum
   conditions. The experimental decolourization reaction rate for MG was
   determined as -r(d) = 0.0779 [(mg dye0(.3)) (g cat(-0.3)) (min(-1))] (x)
   q(t)0(.7). Also, the catalyst had high decolourization efficiencies at
   the end of six sequence usages.

AB In this work, it is studied the treatment of real wastewater
   (intensified with two target compounds) using electro-irradiated
   technologies. Two types of effluents coming from an organic-synthesis
   pharmaceutical industry and the outlet of a municipal wastewater
   treatment plant were intensified with metoprolol (beta-blocker) and
   caffeine (stimulant), respectively. Conductive diamond electrochemical
   oxidation (CDEO), photolysis, sonolysis and all possible combinations
   among these technologies were evaluated for the treatment of both
   wastes. Results demonstrate that complete oxidation of the target
   compounds, as well as mineralization of the organic compounds contained
   in the matrixes, can be attained by all electro-irradiated technologies
   and no salt addition was needed to obtain an efficient treatment. Single
   irradiated technologies were inefficient in the oxidation but their
   combination with CDEO improves significantly the efficiency of the
   process showing clear synergistic effects. However, due to the large
   energy requirement of ultrasound irradiation, this combination is only
   cost-effective in the case of ultraviolet irradiation. (C) 2016 Elsevier

   NPs on thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of phase separation was studied
   by phase diagram construction and viscosity measurement. FESEM images
   exhibited asymmetric structure of the membranes with a dense top layer,
   while contact angle measurements confirmed improved membrane
   hydrophilicity. The performances of the membranes were tested by aqueous
   dye solutions viz., Direct Red 23, Congo Red, and Direct Red 243 as well
   as real textile wastewater. Low rejection rates were observed for
   different aqueous salt solutions following the sequence: MgSO4 (4.1%) >
   Na2SO4 (3.3%) > MgCl2 (1.8%) > NaCl (1.2%). The nanocomposites exhibit
   remarkable antifouling properties compared to the pristine membrane.

AB Hydraulic conditions of constructed wetlands (CWs) are crucial to
   pollutant removal and are influenced by factors such as influent loading
   rates, influent or effluent position or porous media size. The
   performance evaluation of CWs in real application, however, is difficult
   and a visualization analysis is difficult due to the black-box effect.
   In this paper, a nonopaque microcosmic horizontal subsurface flow
   constructed wetland (HSSFCW) reactor was built in the laboratory for an
   efficient and intuitive assessment of the influences of such parameters
   on the hydraulic performance of CWs. Chloride tracer tests were carried
   out to obtain parameters on hydraulic performance by considering
   hydraulic loading rates and different flow inlet-outlet configurations,
   while dye tracer tests were designed for the visualization of solute
   transport and diffusion. In parallel, an identical design of the HSSFCW
   reactor was modeled using the Visual MODFLOW (VM) software in order to
   detect the tracer movement and solute concentration field. Results show
   that the inflow rate and the inlet-outlet configuration have significant
   impacts on the hydraulic performance of a CW influencing RTD curve
   shape, flow path, dead zone distribution and hydraulic efficiency. The
   dead zone and flow path have been visualized and analyzed by comparing
   the dye tracer experiments of VM solute concentration field and
   particulate path-line tracking. In addition, the feasibility and
   reliability of the VM simulation has been verified. The application of
   VM in this study has been robust indicating a possible application for
   further investigations on the influencing factors of real CWs.

AB Electrochemical advanced oxidation processes are the most promising
   methods for destroying and degrading organic and inorganic pollutants
   present in produced water effluents. This study presents the
   electro-oxidation process using graphite electrodes and electro-Fenton
   process using iron electrodes for the treatment of real produced water.
   The effect of operating parameters such as current density on chemical
   oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency was addressed. The result showed
   that electro-Fenton process was more efficient than electro-oxidation
   process where it gave 98% as maximum COD removal efficiency with energy
   consumption of 1.9 kWh/dm(3) at H2O2 concentration of 12 mM, current
   density of 10 mA/cm(2), temperature of 25 degrees C, pH of 3, and
   treatment time of 80 min compared with 96.9% as maximum COD removal
   efficiency with energy consumption of 3 kWh/dm(3) at pH of 6, current
   density of 10 mA/cm(2), temperature of 40 degrees C, and reaction time
   of 80 min when using electro-oxidation process. These results
   demonstrated that electrochemical technologies are very promising
   methods for the treatment of produced water from oil/gas industry, so it
   can be safely disposed of or effectively reused for injection and
   irrigation.

AB Increasing flux of toxic pollutants and harmful microbes ejected by the
   industrial effluents into water resources have been frightening the
   natural ecosystem over the years. Ergo, the present work aims to
   decompose Rhodamine B (RhB), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and
   Bacillus cereus (B. cereus) using a novel delaminated Ti3C2
   MXene/NiFe2O4/V2O5 (D-M/NFO/VO) ternary composite. The construction of
   pristine materials and composites were testified by crystallography
   studies, while the morphological characteristics were ascertained by
   microscopy analyses. In comparison with V2O5 and NiFe2O4/V2O5, 0.5 wt%
   D-M/NFO/VO exhibited improved photoactivity, which decomposed 88.7% RhB,
   72.8% S. aureus and 85.1% B. cereus after 240 min. As an outstanding
   co-catalyst, Ti3C2 MXene can efficiently capture electron and prevented
   the charge carrier recom-bination in the composite. Meanwhile, the
   photocatalytic mechanism of the composite was tested via radical
   trapping analyses and electron spin resonance spectra, which verified
   that the hydroxyl and superoxide anion radicals served as the pivotal
   roles for photodegradation of RhB dye. The real-world viability of
   D-M/NFO/VO photocatalytic system was also examined using the real
   printed ink wastewater-containing RhB. The phytotoxic effects of real
   printed ink wastewater-containing RhB toward the germination seeds of
   Vigna radiata and Vigna unguiculata were significantly decreased after
   D-M/NFO/VO photocatalysis. This work puts forward for the use of visible
   light-assisted catalysts toward ameliorating and eradicating the
   existing multifarious environmental damages.

AB Water pollution has become a worldwide threat as the natural water
   resources are shrinking day by day. Emergent actions are needed to
   conserve water stocks to fulfill the sustainable development goals.
   Herein, we have prepared activated carbon-doped magnetic nanocomposites
   (AC@CoFe2O4) with environment friendly approach and characterized for
   FTIR, XRD, SEM, EDS, BET surface area, and pH(zpc). AC@CoFe2O4
   nanocomposite was applied for the decolorization of toxic food dyes
   (rhodamine B and tartrazine) from wastewater. Effect of ultrasonic
   waves, pH, contact time, surfactants, temperature, and analysis of real
   wastewater systems were studied. Adsorption isotherm, kinetics, and
   thermodynamics of the experiment were calculated for the present removal
   process. The effect of ultrasonication shows that the maximum removal
   percentage for RhB was found to be 92% and for tartrazine, it was found
   to be 86% at 60 min. Ultrasound-assisted adsorption and degradation
   revealed good results because of the formation of highly active H-center
   dot and (OH)-O-center dot radicals in the liquid through the
   decomposition of water molecules by the formation of hot spots under
   ultrasonic waves. Highest decolorization of 69% was obtained for RhB
   with anionic surfactant SDS and climax decolorization of tartrazine was
   acquired in case of CTAB as 60.5%. Analysis of real wastewater samples
   shows that the decolorization of RhB was found to be similar to 91% from
   well-water and similar to 95% removal of tartrazine was observed from
   submersible water on AC@CoFe2O4 nanocomposites. The decolorization best
   fitted (R-2 < 0.988) with Langmuir model and value of Langmuir climax
   decolorization efficiency (Q(0)) was found to be 142.68 and 435.72 mg/g
   for RhB and tartrazine, respectively. Kinetic analysis revealed that
   adsorption follows pseudo-second-order equation. The dye-loaded
   AC@CoFe2O4 nanocomposites were recycled by 0.1 M HCl or NaOH and
   regenerated AC@CoFe2O4 nanocomposites were used up to five rounds with
   better adsorption efficiency.

AB Re-use of the byproduct wastes resulting from different municipal and
   industrial activities in the reclamation of contaminated water is real
   application for green projects and sustainability concepts. In this
   direction, the synthesis of composite sorbent from the mixing of
   waterworks and sewage sludge coated with new nanoparticles named
   "siderite" (WSSS) is the novelty of this study. These particles can be
   precipitated from the iron(II) nitrate using waterworks sludge as
   alkaline agent and source of carbonate. Characterization tests using
   X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy
   dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping revealed that the coating process
   was correctly achieved and siderite nanoparticles were planted on the
   surface of the composite sorbent. Interaction between Congo Red dye and
   composite sorbent was evaluated through a set of batch tests under the
   variation of agitation time, pH of aqueous solution, and sorbent dosage.
   The results proved that the prepared sorbent had a high ability in the
   treatment of water contaminated with Congo Red dye in comparison with
   previous studies and the maximum adsorption capacity reached to maximum
   value i.e. 9416 mg/g. The sorption process was governed by electrostatic
   attractions; however, Sips and Pseudo-second-order models described this
   process with coefficient of determination greater than 0.99.

AB Poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) grafted modified chitosan biocomposite
   adsorbent was obtained by varying the amount of chitosan and acrylic
   acid (AA) to determine heavy metals and cationic methylene blue from
   aqueous solution and industrial effluent. The reaction was carried out
   in a homogeneous aqueous phase by using N,N-methylenebisacrylamide as a
   cross-linker, and ammonium persulfate as an initiator. Fourier transform
   infrared (FTIR) revealed the presence of absorption band in the
   composite for -OH, -NHCO, and -NH2 of chitosan took part in grafting
   with acrylic acid. It was also observed that grafting percentage (G%)
   decreases with increasing chitosan amount in the composite, however, the
   degree of swelling slightly increases with increasing chitosan amount
   due to the amphiphilic nature of the PAA modified chitosan. The
   adsorption behaviors for Cr(VI), Pb(II), and methylene blue (MB) on the
   biocomposite adsorbent were studied for 25 ppm standard solution with
   0.05 g adsorbent dose and at pH 4, 6, and 9.1 for Cr(VI), Pb(II), and
   methylene blue (MB), respectively. The highest removal efficiencies 42%
   and 36% for Cr(VI) and Pb(II), respectively, were given by the composite
   (C-4) prepared from 2:1 chitosan and AA. On the other hand, the
   composite with higher AA (chitosan: AA = 1:7.2) showed a remarkable
   higher MB adsorption efficiency (64%) than other composites. The
   composite adsorbent was applied to reveal its efficiencies for the real
   sample from tannery and textiles. The results revealed that 33% Cr(VI)
   and 36% Pb(II) can be eliminated by a single adsorption of 0.05 g C-4
   (prepared from chitosan and AA at 2:1 ratio) after 2 h of adsorption. On
   the other hand, 53% MB removal was observed for C-1 (obtained from
   chitosan and AA ratio of 1:7.2) with a similar adsorption conditions.

   Of the three substrates, WB and OP served as good materials for the

   laccase for reactive black 5 and 22.68 mu mol h(-1) U-1 laccase for
   reactive orange 16 (RO) was obtained with the WB culture filtrate, and
   11.7 mu mol h(-1) U-1 laccase for reactive violet 5 was observed with OP
   culture filtrate. Importantly, Kiton blue A (KB), reported not to be
   amenable to enzymatic degradation, was degraded by culture filtrate
   borne activities. Products of degradation of KB and RO were identified
   by mass spectrometry, and a pathway of degradation proposed. WB-grown
   culture filtrate decolorized and detoxified real and simulated textile
   effluents by about 40%. The study highlights the use of inexpensive
   materials for the production of enzymes effective on dyes and effluents.

AB Water pollution is still a serious problem for the entire world.
   Adsorption technology is a promising process which is based on the
   fabrication of novel, cheap, non-dangerous and highly sorptive materials
   for application in wastewater purification processes. Nanomaterials are
   functional groups which find use in many important fields such as
   medicine, food processing and agriculture. This review collects
   information from published works about the use of carbon nanotubes as
   efficient and promising adsorbents in chromium removal from (real or
   synthesised) wastewater. For this purpose, isotherm (Langmuir,
   Freundlich, etc.), kinetic (pseudo-first-, second-order, etc.),
   thermodynamic (free-energy Gibbs, enthalpy, entropy) and
   desorption-regeneration studies were discussed in detail. Moreover,
   significant factors such as pH, agitation time, temperature, adsorbent

AB Delonix regia pods have been used to produce high-efficiency and
   low-cost activated carbons using different activation methods. The
   ability of these prepared sorbents to remove cations [Cs-137, Sr-85,
   La(III), Eu(III), Co(II), U(VI)] and anions [Se-75, Cr(VI), Mo(VI)] was
   evaluated in mono-component systems and the sorbents number 11, 13, 25,
   and 35 showed high removal efficiency. These sorbents also show the high
   ability to remove organic pollutants such as methylene blue and phenol.
   This study highlighted the extensive applicability of these low-cost
   sorbents in the sequestration of anionic and cationic radionuclides from
   real radioactive wastewaters and different environmental samples.

   nanocomposite (Fe3O4@SiO2@Kit-6-NH2) was synthesized as an adsorbent for
   removing Carmoisine food dye from aqueous solutions. Methods: The
   nanocomposite was chemically synthesized and was characterized by X-ray
   diffraction analysis (XRD), vibrating sample magnetometery (VSM),
   energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Taguchi
   orthogonal array experimental design method was used to optimize the
   experimental conditions, including adsorbent amount, pH of the solution,
   amount of salt, the volume of sample and contact time. Pseudo
   first-order, pseudo second-order, intra-particle diffusion and Elovich
   kinetic models were investigated to study the kinetic parameters of the
   sorption process. Results: The kinetic data corresponded to the pseudo
   second-order kinetic model with R2 = 0.9999. Also, adsorption data were
   analyzed using Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin isotherm models. The
   results indicated that the data were well fitted to the Freundlich
   isotherm model (R2 = 0.9984, n=1.0786). The reusability tests showed
   that the proposed nanocomposite could be used for more than 8 cycles
   with removal efficiency higher than 90%. Conclusion: The applicability
   study of the proposed nanocomposite proved its ability for efficient
   removal of Carmoisine dye from real aqueous samples.

AB Protecting public health from pathogens is critical when treating
   wastewater to drinking water standards (i.e., planned water reuse).
   Viruses are a principal concern, yet real-time monitoring strategies do
   not currently measure virus removal through reuse processes. Flow
   cytometry (FCM) has enabled rapid and sensitive bacteria monitoring in
   water treatment applications, but methods for virus and protozoa
   monitoring remain immature. We discuss recent advances in the FCM field
   and FCM applications for quantifying microorganisms in water. We focus
   on flow virometry (FVM) developments, as virus enumeration methods show
   promise for water reuse applications. Ultimately, we propose FVM for
   near real-time monitoring across treatment to more accurately validate
   virus particle removal and for pilot studies to characterize removal
   through understudied unit processes.

AB Organic compounds present on industrial wastes are mostly resistant to
   conventional biological and chemical treatments. Textile industry has
   presented several environmental problems mainly related to the use and
   management of water resources. It has a high consumption of potable and
   underground water in its processes. These wastewaters are one of the
   most polluting of the industrial area.
   The Advanced Oxidation Process AOPs allow to decompose organic matter in
   a non-selectively way by the attack of center dot OH radicals.
   This work presents the characterization and application of several
   catalysts for real textile effluent treatment (from an industry
   dedicated to dyeing and finishing clothes; in Buenos Aires
   province).Three different iron catalysts are used: 1 degrees)
   Synthesized in a laboratory, 2 degrees) Waste from metallurgic industry
   and 3 degrees) commercial steel wool. These are characterized using
   SEM/EDX. The effluent is characterized before and after treatment, where
   the degradation is following by measure of % COD, pH and Fe2+ content in
   solution by condition different of treatment. The effect of catalysts on
   the applied treatment is studied, which consists of an oxidation of
   organic matter by action of Fe species and H2O2 in solution, assuming a
   Fenton process a pH neutral.
   The results show that the three catalysts are efficient for use in the
   process of degradation of the real textile effluent. In all cases, the
   COD final values are suitable for discharge into a sewer system.

AB Reactive dyes are the most abundantly used in textile industry due to
   their high color fastness, wide color spectrum as well as low energy
   consumption. The presence of these dyes in effluent released into
   receiving waters has become a serious environmental problem not only
   related to their color but mainly because of the hazardous byproducts.
   An environmentally sustainable development policy in textile industry
   requires development of new technologies to reduce water consumption as
   well as negative environmental impact of discharged wastewater. Advanced
   oxidation processes (AOPs) are the most promising technology for
   decolorization and mineralization of wastewater contamination. This
   paper presents the results of ozonation, Fenton's oxidation and H2O2/UV
   treatment of simulated as well as industrial textile wastewater
   containing Reactive Black 5. The AOPs were carried out under varied
   process parameters such as: dye concentration, pH, oxidant and detergent
   doses and wide range concentration of NaCl. The decolorization was
   followed by absorbance while oxidation and mineralization progress by
   COD and TOC measurements respectively. The almost completely inhibition
   of decolorization in the presence of NaCl in concentration usually used
   in industry (60 - 80 g/L) was observed for Fenton reagent. The slight
   inhibition was observed for H2O2/UV system while for ozonation there was
   no influence of NaCl on the decolorization. The similar relationship of
   the influence of anionic detergent concentration was observed. The
   experiments indicated that ozonation is the best method from TOC and COD
   removal point of view. For the decolorization of real textile effluents
   two streams were used 1) containing C.I. Reactive Yellow 145, Red 195,
   Blue 221 and 2) Reactive Black 5. As a result of the treatment, almost
   complete decolorization of the wastewater was obtained. Considering both
   the experimental results and technological problems, it can be presumed
   that advanced oxidation with a application of ozone or hydrogen
   peroxide/UV are a very promising techniques for potential industrial
   implementation, however from economic point of view the more reasonable
   is the ozonation process.

AB In this study, hydrochar-based-eggshell was prepared via the subcritical
   water medium (SCWM) and used as a catalyst in the thermally activated
   peroxide oxidation (TAPO) approach for crystal violet and dye bathing
   wastewater degradation. The catalytic activities for the raw eggshell
   (RES) and hydrochar-based-eggshell (HES) were compared. RES and HES were
   characterized using a scanning electron microscope
   (SEM),energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX), and Fourier
   transforms infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The affecting parameters on
   the degradation process were optimized using response surface
   methodology (RSM). The effects of temperature (293-333 K), amount of
   catalyst (5-25 mg/50 mL), the concentration of H2O2 (0-8 mM), and
   treatment time (10-70 min) on the TAPO method were investigated using
   central composite design (CCD). For the crystal violet removal, two
   models were developed. Both models were significant and can be used to
   describe the design space. Also, the dye bathing wastewater degradation
   was described by another developed model, which had a high correlation
   coefficient (R2 = 0.97). In general, catalytic activity for HES was
   higher than RES. The degradation of crystal violet reached 98.10% when a
   20 mg HES catalyst and 6 mM H2O2 at 323 K for 55 min were used. While
   97% of the color of dye bathing wastewater was removed in 55 min at 323
   K using 25 mg of HES and 4 mM H2O2. This study showed that the
   hydrolyzed eggshells could be used in the oxidation of crystal violet
   and dye bathing wastewater by the thermally activated peroxide oxidation
   method.

AB Textile industry generates a high volume of wastewater containing
   various type of pollutants. Although high color and chemical oxygen
   demand (COD) removals are achieved with the combination of biological
   and chemical treatment processes, reverse osmosis (RO) process is
   generally needed for water recovery due to high conductivity of the
   textile wastewater. In this study, a pilot scale RO process containing
   one spiral wound membrane element was operated under three different
   operational modes, i.e. concentrated, complete recycle and continuous,
   to collect more information for the prediction of a real-scale RO
   process performance. It was claimed that complete recycle mode of
   operation enabled mimicking the operational conditions exerted on the
   first membrane, whereas continuous mode of operation created conditions
   very similar to the ones exerted on the last membrane element in a real
   scale RO process train. In the concentrated and continuous mode of
   operation, water recovery and flux were around 70% and 19 L/m(2)/h
   (LMH). Permeate produced in the RO process can be safely reused in the
   dyeing process as the feed and permeate conductivities were around 5500
   mu S/cm and 150 mu S/cm, respectively, at 70% water recovery. However,
   color concentration in the concentrate exceeded the discharge limits and
   would need further treatment. The RO performance was accurately
   predicted by ROSA simulations.

AB Proteinaceous materials are promising for membranes due to greater
   mechanical strength, in-built functionalities, amphiphilicity and high
   molecular loading capacity. Herein, a novel strategy of
   functionalization of silk nanofibrils with metal oxyhydroxide and
   fabrication of ultrafast permeable multi-layered and self-cleaning
   membrane was demonstrated. Typically, 1.9 mu m thick multilayered
   membrane efficiently purifies macromolecules, dyes, pharmaceutical,
   surfactants and oil-water emulsion contaminated wastewater with
   rejection rate > 89% with the flux rate > 883 L m(2) h(-1). Further, the
   potential of the multilayered membrane was tested for series of
   different feed concentrations of fluoride and As (V) to validate the
   commercial applicability of the multilayered membranes for industry
   wastewater. Notably, even at higher concentration of 10-30 mg L-1, >96%
   for fluoride and >87% for As (V) rejection was obtained. Furthermore,
   the functionalized multilayered membrane exhibited outstanding
   performance for fluoride removal in real water streams, where, it
   purifies approximately 4710 L.m(-2) in two consecutive cycles, before
   the quality of the effluents no longer meets WHO criteria. However, the
   remarkable separation efficiency principally attributed to adsorption
   sites on the surface of the membrane. Thus, various regeneration
   strategies were established based on the nature of pollutants. More
   importantly, photocatalytic Fenton-like reaction assisted self-cleaning
   property of the multilayered membrane is demonstrated for regeneration
   of organic fouled membrane. Overall, the present multilayered membrane
   exhibits superior performance in purifying organic, inorganic
   contaminated water and oil-water emulsion with excellent recyclability;
   hence, envisaged its application for Universal water purification.

AB This research aimed to optimization of the electrocoagulation process
   was investigated in terms of chemical and physical mechanisms using
   Box-Behnken response surface design (BBD). The experimental conditions
   were optimized by examining the interaction effects of initial pH,
   electrolysis time, and current density on COD and color removal
   efficiencies. The results showed that the calculated response functions
   agreed well with the experimental data, where R-2 = 94.87% for COD and
   97.86% for color. An ANOVA analysis revealed p-values lower than 0.05 at
   the 95% confidence interval (CI) (p = 0.05), confirming that the
   quadratic models were statistically significant and supportive of the
   phenomenon study on COD and color removal. According to BBD results, for
   the maximum removal of COD and color, the optimal independent variables
   were a pH of 4.0, electrolysis time of 60 min, and current density of
   300 A/m(2). Predicted removal efficiencies of COD and color under
   optimal operating conditions were 71.96% and 96.38%, respectively. Three
   experiments conducted to confirm optimal operating conditions revealed
   mean values of COD and color removal efficiency to be 73.13% and 94.68%,
   respectively. These findings confirmed that predictions of optimal
   operating conditions generated by the response surface design model were
   reliable.

   The rate of degradation of dye wastewater was in order of individual
   Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) < series stack < parallel stack. The corn cob
   biochar was used as an additive in the MFC to improve the efficiency of
   the individual MFC unit. The addition of 0.5 g corn cob biochar enhanced
   the power output to 38.6 mW/m(2) from 0.47 mW/m(2) in the MFC individual
   unit without the biochar additive. The simultaneous COD reduction, TDS
   reduction and decolourisation of dye wastewater achieved are 82.14%, 68%

AB The textile industry uses large amounts of water that becomes wastewater
   contaminated with salts, starches, acids, peroxides, enzymes, dyes, and
   other pollutants. Here, we optimized the treatment of textile industry
   wastewater by electrocoagulation (EC) using aluminum and iron electrodes
   employing a response surface methodology (RSM) approach. Hence, the
   effects and interactions of the variables of the process (pH, current
   density, and reaction time) on turbidity and chemical oxygen demand
   (COD) removal were evaluated using the Box-Behnken mathematical model in
   a monopolar batch reactor. Analyses of variance were also performed to
   estimate model responses and optimum conditions. After determining the
   mathematically optimized variables of the EC process, its efficiency in
   the removal of heavy metals and cations from textile wastewater was also
   evaluated for both the electrodes under study. Experimental data yielded
   89.92 and 86.38% in COD removal, and 99.75 and 97.67% in turbidity
   removal for Al and Fe electrodes. Moreover, the theoretical maximum
   removals are 93.58 and 87.08% of COD for Al and Fe electrodes and 100%
   of TB for both electrodes. The removal of U, As, V, Si, P, and Pb was
   above 90% with both electrode materials. Although both electrodes
   removed part of the cations, the aluminum electrodes yielded higher
   removals of Ca+2 and Na+1 (46.19 and 31.94%). Therefore, our study
   demonstrates that the RSM and Box-Behnken are suitable for optimizing
   the electrocoagulation process to treat textile wastewater and that the
   EC is an efficient technology for removing different organic and
   inorganic pollutants.

AB The objective of this study is to investigate the potential application
   of the anodic oxidation (AO) on two electrolytic cells (monopolar (Cell
   1) and bipolar (Cell 2)) containing boron-doped diamond electrodes on
   the treatment of real textile effluents to study the reuse possibility
   of treated wastewater in the textile industry process. AO is applied in
   the flocculation coagulation pretreatment of both upstream (BH) and
   downstream (BS) effluents. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) results show
   that the final COD removal obtained for the BH effluent in the case of
   Cell 1 and Cell 2 is 800 and 150mg O2L-1 after 5 and 6h of electrolysis,
   respectively. The treatments of the BS effluent allow for obtaining a
   final COD of 76mgL(-1)for Cell 1 and a total mineralization for Cell 2.
   The obtained results demonstrate that the apparent mineralization
   kinetics of both effluents when using Cell 2 are about four times faster
   than the one obtained by Cell 1 and highlight the important contribution
   of the bipolar cell. Besides, the energy consumption values show that
   the treatment of the BH effluent by Cell 1 consumes 865kWhkgCOD(-1)
   against 411kWhkgCOD(-1) by Cell 2. Therefore, the use of Cell 2
   decreases the energy cost by 2.1-6.65 times when compared to Cell 1 in
   the case of the BH and BS effluent treatment, respectively.

AB Dual functional innovative approaches were developed to tackle the algal
   scum problem in water by utilizing the algal (Spirogyra sp.) biomass
   waste for organic dye-laden industrial wastewater treatment, a global
   problem, and challenge. Therefore, an algal biochar-based nanocomposite
   (nAgBC) was synthesized and employed as a lowcost adsorbent for Congo
   red (CR) removal. Surface morphology, physicochemical characteristics,
   elemental composition, phase, and stability of the nanocomposite was
   analyzed using BET, FESEM-EDX, FTIR, XRD, XPS, and TGA. The
   nanocomposite was found to be thermostable, mesoporous with large and
   heterogeneous surface area, containing nAg as doped material, where -OH,
   NH, C--O, C--C, SO, and CH are the surface binding active functional
   groups. Maximum adsorption efficiency of 95.92% (18 mg L-1 CR) was
   achieved (qe = 34.53 mg g-1) with 0.5 g L-1 of nanocomposite after 60
   min, at room temperature (300 K) at pH 6. Isotherm and kinetic model
   suggested multilayer chemisorption, where adsorption thermodynamics
   indicated spontaneous reaction. Fluorescens spectral analysis of CR
   confirmed the formation of CR supramolecule, supporting enhanced
   adsorption. Furthermore, the result suggested a 5th cycle reusability
   and considerable efficacy towards real textile industrial effluents.
   Synergistic effects of the active surface functional groups of the
   biochar and nAg, along with the overall surface charge of the composite
   lead to chemisorption, electrostatic attraction, H-bonding, and surface
   complexation with CR molecules. Thus, synthesized nAgBC can be
   applicable to mitigate the wastewater for cleaner production and
   environment.

AB In recent years, the perception that conventional treatment of waters
   and effluents produce secondary effluents containing various substances
   still considered toxic has increased the investigation for more
   efficient treatment methods. The adsorption process on activated carbons
   (ACs) is an acknowledged tertiary method or of post- treatment of
   effluents. In this work, several ACs obtained from the flamboyant pods
   were used for the first time for the treatment of effluents generated in
   an industrial laundry. The adsorbents produced by chemical activation
   and physical activation presented high surface areas (from 265.5 to
   561.1 m(2) g(-1)), microporous and mesoporous physical characteristic
   and various acidic and basic functional groups. Two types of effluents
   (one raw and another previously treated through activated sludge) were
   submitted to adsorption processes and a decrease of the initial values
   of apparent color, turbidity and COD was observed. On the other hand,
   the results indicated that the contribution of the porous membranes
   (used in the filtration step) for the adsorption process must be
   considered in order to assess the real adsorption capacity. Furthermore,
   the UV -vis spectra of the effluents indicated the ACs have a high
   capacity of adsorption of compounds which absorb in the visible and
   ultraviolet regions. The adsorption of several components present in the
   effluents suggests that the flamboyant pods can be explored to produce
   several ACs with potential to be applied together (as auxiliary agents)
   with conventional treatments and to improve the reuse of secondary
   effluents produced after biological treatment.

AB In this study, lignin-derived zeolite templated carbon materials were
   fabricated to remove the organic contaminant, methyl orange. Response
   surface methodology with Box-Behnken design was used to optimize the
   adsorption parameters. Based on Box-Behnken design, a quadratic model
   was developed to correlate the adsorption variables with the response,
   removal efficiency. Analysis of variance revealed the adsorbent dosage
   as the most influential adsorption variable. Lignin derived ZSM-5 (PZ)
   and mordenite (PM) templated carbon materials exhibited high surface
   area; 476.0 and 716.0 m(2)/g respectively. The maximum theoretical
   adsorption capacity of PZ and PM for methyl orange was 514.0 and 225.0
   mg/g, respectively. The experimental kinetic data best fitted to
   pseudo-second-order model for both the adsorbents. PZ adsorbent was also
   utilized to treat real wastewater containing dyes and achieved 40 %
   methyl orange removal efficiency. Adsorption thermodynamic study
   revealed the process as spontaneous, exothermic and also indicated the
   increment in entropy after adsorption.

   activated sludge (CAS) and preformed aerobic granular sludge (AGS) in
   synthetic wastewater as seed in two reactors, reactor-1 (R1) and
   reactor-2 (R2), respectively. The results showed that complete
   granulation was achieved in R1 (sludge volume index at 5 min (SVI5) and
   30 min (SVI30): 19.4 mL/g; granule size: 210 mu m) within 65 days, while
   it only required 28 days in R2 (SVI5 and SVI30: 27.3 mL/g; granule size:
   496 mu m). The removal of COD, NH4+-N and TN in R1 (49.8%, 98.8%, and
   41.6%) and R2 (53.6%, 96.9%, and 40.8%) were comparable in 100% real TWW
   treatment, but stable performance was achieved much faster in R2. The
   real TWW had an inhibitory effect on heterotrophic bacteria activity,
   but it had no inhibition on ammonia-oxidizing bacteria activity. AGS
   with a larger particle size had a higher microbial tolerance to real
   TWW. Furthermore, filamentous Thiothrix in the AGS in R2 disappeared
   when treating real TWW, leading to the improvement of sludge
   settleability. Thus, seeding preformed AGS is suggested as a rapid
   start-up method for a robust AGS system in treating real TWW.

AB Textile wastewater contains significant amounts of dyes and chemicals,
   which makes it very difficult to be treated. Reactive Black 5 is one of
   the most widely used azo dyes that cause severe impact on environment
   and aquatic life. Activated carbons are known for their high adsorption
   capacities, and the objective of the current study was to prepare an
   effective low-cost adsorbent. H3PO4 acid-activated sawdust and rice husk
   which were prepared using a simple and low-cost method successfully
   adsorbed Reactive Black 5 (RB 5) in hypersaline synthetic and real
   textile dye bath wastewaters. SEM analysis of activated carbon made from
   these two materials showed an enhanced pore structure. 0.10 g of
   activated sawdust carbon decolorized 88, 97 and 75% of neat RB 5
   solution, synthetic textile wastewater and real textile dye bath
   wastewater, respectively. RB 5 adsorption is pH dependent, and low pH
   facilitates the dye adsorption. Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models
   were used to analyze the equilibrium adsorption data, and only the
   Langmuir isotherm model shows a good correlation (R-2=0.99). Kinetic
   data match well with the pseudo-second-order model, and the calculated
   rate constants are 6.09x10(-3) g mg(-1) min(-1) and 9.88x10(-3) g mg(-1)
   min(-1) for activated carbon of sawdust and rice husk, respectively.
   Thermodynamic parameters, Delta G(0), Delta H-0 and Delta S-0, for both
   types of activated carbon show that the adsorption process is favorable,
   endothermic and spontaneous.

AB A facile synthesis of nanocomposites of ternary metal oxides
   (Ag2O/NiO/ZnO) has been reported. Three ternary nanocomposites A/N/Z-1,
   A/N/Z-2, and A/N/Z-3 with different molar ratios of silver oxide (10 %,
   20 % and 30 %, respectively) have been synthesized by decorating a
   binary N/Z (NiO/ZnO = 1:1) nanocomposite. The diameter of the particles
   in N/Z binary nanocomposite is approximately 31.59 & PLUSMN; 5.03 nm,
   and the size of the decorated silver oxide in the A/N/Z-3 ternary
   nanocomposite is 5.92 +/- 1.36 nm as deduced from TEM analysis. The
   Ag2O/NiO/ZnO nanocomposites have efficiently catalyzed the reduction of
   various nitrophenols, dyes, and their mixtures. Among the synthesized
   nanocomposites, A/N/Z-3 has the highest silver oxide content that
   re-duces 4-nitrophenol ([pNP] = 0.16 mM) in the shortest time (7 min).
   Therefore, A/N/Z-3 has been chosen to investigate other parameters for
   pNP's reduction, including the amounts of catalyst, pNP and sodium
   borohy-dride. A/N/Z-3 (6.41 mu g mL-1) reduces different nitrophenols
   ([NP] = 0.16 mM) in following order: oNP (2-nitrophenol: 2 min) > mNP
   (3-nitrophenol: 2 min) > pNP (4-nitrophenol: 7 min) > 2,4,6TNP (2, 4,
   6-trinitrophe-nol: 13 min) in the presence of sodium borohydride (40
   mM). Similarly, A/N/Z-3 (6.02 mu g mL-1, except for MB, the amount used
   was 29.41 mu g mL-1) reduces different dyes (0.02 mM) in the following
   order: MO (methyl orange: 2 min and 30 s) > CR (congo red: 2 min and 30
   s) > RB (rhodamine-B: 4 min) > MB (methylene blue: 9 min). Further,
   A/N/Z-3 reduces nitrophenols' mixture, dyes' mixture, simulated
   effluents (EFF1) sample and a real industrial sample (dye bath
   effluents: DBE) in 8 min, 8 min, 6 min and 12 min, respectively, and
   also reused up to five cycles. Hence, this highly efficient,
   inexpensive, and easily reusable robust catalyst can be used to remove
   toxic organic pollutants from industrial wastewater.

AB In this work, magnetic cobalt nanoparticles (CoNPs) were synthesized and
   applied to the removal of Remazol golden yellow RNL (RGY) from aqueous
   solutions and textile wastewater. The CoNPs were characterized and the
   Co content found in the CoNPs was 60.38% (m/m). The analysis of X-ray
   Diffraction (XRD) and Raman Spectroscopy indicated the presence of Co-0
   and CoO in the composition of the material, as confirmed by
   Thermogravimetric Analysis coupled to Mass Spectrometry (TG-MS). Images
   obtained by the Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) showed that the
   CoNPs have sizes smaller than 10 nm, sphere morphology and high
   agglomeration capacity. The results obtained by nitrogen
   adsorption-desorption suggested that the nanomaterial presented a
   mesoporous characteristic, low specific surface area (15.70 m(2) g(-1))
   and a pore volume and pore diameter of 0.072 cm(3) g(-1) and 3.64 nm,
   respectively. CoNPs removed the RGY with high efficiency, reaching
   almost 100% removal in 30 min. The kinetic results showed that the
   reaction followed pseudo-second-order kinetics. Additionally, the
   removal process can be altered depending on the experimental condition.
   For instance, under acidic conditions, the reductive degradation
   prevailed, while in neutral or basic conditions, two simultaneous
   processes occur: reductive degradation and adsorption. Finally, CoNPs
   were applied to textile wastewater. The results showed high
   discoloration, reaching almost 88%. However, there was only a 32%
   decrease in chemical oxygen demand, showing that CoNPs are efficient at
   removing organic dyes from aqueous solutions.

AB Regardless of its toxicity, chromium is an element that lives with
   humans due to its various uses, and while the toxic character of Cr(VI)
   is of wide knowledge, this element in its (III) oxidation state is also
   harmful, and this harmfulness increased by the risk of its potential
   oxidation to the (VI) oxidation state. Thus, there is a constant effort
   to find technologies that eliminated this Cr(III) from the different
   effluents in which it is present. In liquid solutions, it seems that
   adsorption is one of the most popular methods, and also the finding of
   adsorbents which eliminated Cr(III) most easily, most selectively and
   with better yields. The recovery of this element from the loaded
   adsorbent and the recycle of the adsorbent, are also two points that
   always, but this is not the real situation, must be taking into account.
   This manuscript reviewed the most recent advances (papers published in
   the 2019 year) about the use of adsorption, and adsorbents aimed at the
   recovery of Cr(III) from liquid solutions.

AB The effect of auxiliary substances (NaCl, Na2CO3, and CH3COOH) used in
   real dyeing processes on the adsorption capacity of low-moor peat for
   reactive dyes (Reactive Blue 19, Reactive Blue 81, Reactive Black 5) and
   acid dyes (Acid Black 1, Acid Blue 9) was investigated. The adsorption
   of the dyes was studied as a function of dye concentration (1-1,000 mg
   L-1) and the properties of peat, using a batch method. The experimental
   data were analyzed using the Langmuir, Freundlich, Dubinin-Radushkevich,
   and Sips isotherm models. The effect of auxiliary substances depended on
   the dye-adsorbent system - the lower the binding ability of the dye on
   the peat, the greater the effect of the substances. The maximum dyes
   adsorption capacity and the affinity of the binding sites increased in
   the presence of auxiliaries in the solution. The presence of CH3COOH was
   an important factor since H+ in the solution affected the peat surface
   charge by protonation reaction and the possibility of binding anionic
   dyes via electrostatic interaction. Only CH3COOH at low pH affected the
   peat surface charge because of the very good buffering capacity of peat.
   NaCl and Na2CO3 increased the intermolecular forces as well as the
   dimerization process of reactive dyes in the solution. The Sips equation
   fitted the experimental results best. This model combines the Langmuir
   and Freundlich equations, suggesting that the mechanism of dyes binding
   is more complex and does not follow an ideal monolayer adsorption.

AB This work proposes a kinetic model for the reactions involved in the
   heterogeneous copper-based Fenton-type oxidation of mixed recalcitrant
   compounds in a real industrial effluent from the alkaline sulfite
   treatment of wood. This kind of treatment is unusual in this industry
   due to the complexity of the effluents and the high costs involved in
   total mineralization of the organic matter. Nevertheless, conversion of
   recalcitrant to degradable compounds and catalyst recovery can make the
   difference. The complexity of the effluent and the great number of
   compounds formed as intermediates, make extremely difficult the
   identification and quantification of the individual reactions that occur
   during oxidation. To solve this drawback TOC parameter was used as a
   representative measurement. To verify the level of TOC degradation
   produced by the heterogeneous catalysis reaction, experiences of
   homogeneous catalysis and adsorption were accomplished. The studied
   temperature range was 45-80 degrees C. A two-step kinetic model was
   applied to TOC reduction in heterogeneous and homogeneous oxidations,
   admitting two sequential steps of oxidation: a first fast stage (seconds
   stage) followed by a slow one (minutes stages). Kinetic constants were
   obtained for both processes and activation energies were also determined
   for the minutes stage step (33.17kJ/mol and 15.13kJ/mol, respectively).
   Homogeneous catalysis studies confirm mass transfer limitations in
   heterogeneous oxidations. Experiences of adsorption of organic matter on
   CuO/-Al2O3 catalyst demonstrated that this phenomenon is exothermic and
   cannot be neglected. The activation energy of adsorption was determined
   as 7.32kJ/mol. Catalysts were characterized through SEM, EDS, XRD, FTIR,
   and TGA.Graphical Abstract

AB A microbial fuel cell is a rapidly growing, eco-friendly and green
   technology. As per this technology, the microorganisms are employed to
   convert the chemical energy stored in the biodegradable portion of
   organic matter into direct electric current by simultaneously treating
   the wastewater. In this study, dual-chambered H-type mediator-less and
   membrane-less microbial fuel cell was operated and was optimized using
   synthetic wastewater as a substrate. The influence of various factors
   such as cathodic electron acceptors, electrode configuration, electrode
   spacing on chemical oxygen demand removal and current output were
   investigated. The maximum current of 1.72 mA was obtained using
   synthetic wastewater with potassium permanganate as effective catholyte,
   electrode spacing of 2 cm from the salt bridge and surface area of 98
   cm(2). This study also investigated the effect of substrate in the
   optimized MFC by applying different real wastewaters (municipal
   wastewater, dairy wastewater, cassava wastewater) and found a superior
   performance by dairy wastewater with maximum current output of 5.23 mA
   and chemical oxygen demand removal of 94%. Electron microscopic
   observations revealed the development of biofilm on the electrode
   surface, which was responsible for biocatalytic activity in the
   microbial fuel cell during the operation. The current generated using
   microbial fuel cell was supplied to peroxicoagulation process and was
   used for the removal of rhodamine B dye. Decolorization of 98% achieved
   by the novel microbial fuel cell-coupled peroxicoagulation system. The
   novel microbial fuel cell-coupled peroxicoagulation is an
   energy-efficient as well as cost-effective technique.

AB The increase in dye-containing effluents that are discharged into the
   environment and the need to remediate the water bodies from the adverse
   effect of these dye pollutants have motivated a lot of research work. In
   this study, ZnO and TiO2 heterojunction systems (MO) embedded in
   cellulose nanocrystals (CNC), derived from sawdust, are reported. The
   nanocomposites (CNC/MO) were subsequently used as photocatalyst for the
   degradation of methyl blue (MB). The nanocomposites were characterized
   using SEM/EDs, XRD, and the degradation of MB were determined by UV-vis
   spectrophotometer. The XRD analysis showed characteristic peaks of CNC
   and the metal oxide (MO) upon the nanocomposite formation. A reduction
   in the intensity of peak at 30 degrees, attributed to the cellulose 1
   beta phase of pristine CNC, was observed. The morphological evaluation
   revealed that the nanocomposite exhibited intertwined spherical and
   rod-like shape on the surface. The effects of some key operating
   parameters, such as initial pH, catalyst dosage, and initial dye
   concentration on the degradation of MB were investigated. Higher
   degradation percentage (98.52%) of MB was observed for the CNC/MO at
   optimum pH 6. The adopted kinetics models showed that MB degradation was
   well described by the pseudo-second order model. The application of this
   nanocomposites in real industrial sample will confirm its robustness.

AB Textile wastewater has been known for its high resistance toward
   conventional wastewater treatment because of its low biodegradability
   index (BI). In this study, the catalytic ozonation of real textile
   wastewater has been carried out using a novel magnetic oxidized
   g-C3N4/Al2O3 (O@g-C3N4/ Al2O3) nanocatalyst. The effect of Al2O3 content
   on the catalytic activity of nanocatalyst was investigated, and the
   results marked that the nanocomposite with the equal mass ratio of Al2O3
   to magnetic oxidized g-C3N4 had the best performance. The material
   char-acterization was investigated using Field-Emission Scanning
   Electron Microscopy (FESEM), Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM), X-Ray
   Diffraction (XRD), Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), Fourier Transform
   Infrared (FTIR), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis,
   respectively. The effect of pH, catalyst dosage, and oxygen flow rate
   were studied, and the maximum performance was achieved at a pH of 7.1,
   the oxygen flow rate of 1.5 L/min, and the catalyst dosage of 0.5 g/L.
   The ozonation kinetics plots of the single ozonation process (SOP) and
   catalytic ozonation process (COP) showed two different linear parts. The
   rate of COD removal was much greater in the first 5 min of ozonation
   because of oxidation of easily degradable compounds. Furthermore, the
   rate constant of COP after 5 min of ozonation was four times higher
   compared to that of SOP, indicating the greater potential of COP toward
   oxidation of recalcitrant compounds. However, the rate constant in the
   first 5 min of COP was only two times greater than that of SOP, which is
   a result of oxidation of easily degradable compounds. The COD and color
   removal of 77% and 99% and BI of 0.74 were attained in 60 min in the COP
   process. However, treated wastewater resulted in 127 mg/L residual COD
   of initial wastewater after catalytic ozonation meeting EPA standards
   discharge for textile and dyeing industry effluent. The results of
   regeneration experiments indicated that the COD removal decreased only
   about 8% after five regeneration cycles.

AB Application of agrochemicals in farming sector to control insects and
   pests; and use of synthetic organic dyes to color the products are
   increasing continuously due to the rapid growth of industries. During
   the application process many industries releases toxic agrochemicals and
   dyes in to the aquatic environment and on land without the proper
   treatment. Due to their toxicity the disposal of such chemicals is of
   utmost importance. Biochar offers the ability to remediate these
   substances from environmental matrices because of their high sorption
   ability of pollutants from water and soil. This review highlights the
   development and advancement of biochar-based treatment for abatement of
   agrochemicals and synthetic organic dyes, involving its technical
   aspects and the variables connected with removing these kinds of
   pollutants. Several optimization parameters like temperature, pH,
   chemical concentration, biochar properties, time, and co-existing ions
   have been elaborated. Literature survey shows that most of the
   researches on biochar application have been conducted in the batch mode.
   Hence there is an urgent need to apply this beneficial technique for the
   remediation of pollutants at the larger scale in the real water and soil
   samples. A comprehensive summary on sorption kinetics and adsorption
   isotherms with regards to pollutant removal is also presented. This
   review also covers the cost analysis of various techniques where biochar
   has been used as an adsorbent. Thus this review makes an easy roadmap
   for the further development in biochar and biochar based composites and
   expansion of these demanding areas of research in biochar and their
   applications. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   focused on the efficient utilization of lignocellulosic biomass waste
   (rice straw) as a biosorbent in the treatment process. The experiment
   was designed by response surface methodology (RSM) and conducted using a
   bioreactor that operated at 1-3 days hydraulic retention times (HRT)
   with PPBE concentrations at 20, 60 and 100%. The bioreactor was fed with
   real PPBE having initial ammonia-N and total phosphorus (TP)
   concentrations that varied between 11.74 and 59.02 mg/L and 31-161 mg/L,
   respectively. Findings from the optimized approach by RSM indicated
   84.51% and 91.71% ammonia-N and 77.62% and 84.64% total phosphorus
   reduction in concentration for EAS and RAC-EAS, respectively, with high
   nitrification rate observed in both bioreactors. Kinetic model
   optimization indicated that modified stover models was the best suited
   and were statistically significant (R2 >= 0.98) in the analysis of
   substrate removal rates for ammonia-N and total phosphorus. Maximum
   nutrients elimination was attained at 60% PPBE and 48 h HRT. Therefore,
   the model can be utilized in the design and optimization of EAS and
   RAC-EAS systems and consequently in the prediction of bioreactor
   behavior.

   investigated. Microbial community structure of the co-cultures before
   and after treatment with SMFs of different intensity was analyzed
   through high-throughput sequencing and quantitative real-time polymerase
   chain reaction. The results showed that ARB decolorization efficiency by
   the defined co-culture was 1.25-fold to 1.51-fold elevated by 24.6-305.0
   mT SMF. The best ARB decolorization and chemical oxygen demand (COD)
   removal performances by the co-culture were both achieved with 95.0 mT
   SMF. By contrast, biomass multiplication and sedimentation property of
   AS systems were not significantly influenced by SMF. Higher activities
   of intracellular key enzymes were determined (with 95.0 mT SMF) as
   responsible for better decolorization and COD removal performances.
   Bacteria belonging
   toProlixibacter,Corynebacterium,Pelagibacterium,Demequina,andSphingobact
   eriumwhich might be responsible for azo dye decolorization and aromatic
   compounds biodegradation were significantly enriched only in presence of
   SMF. Fungal generaCandidaandPichiawere also significantly enriched by
   41.4-305.0 mT SMF, which might be responsible for higher treatment
   efficiency. Practitioner points
   Dye degradation was enhanced by combination of static magnetic field and
   yeasts. Improvement of enzyme activity was responsible for better
   treatment performance. Putative azo-degrading-related bacteria and fungi
   were selectively enriched. High relative abundance
   ofCandidaandPichiaensured high decolorization effects. Potentially

AB The present work focused on the photo-Fenton performance using Fe+2
   immobilized on chitosan and alginate spheres for degrading methylene
   blue dye (MB) and a real effluent (RE) from a pulp and paper mill
   industry. With the aim of optimizing iron sorption onto these matrices,
   the time sorption was evaluated in the presence of ultrasound
   (sono-sorption) and in its absence (conventional method). SEM/EDS, XRD
   and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were used to characterize the
   catalyst prepared. The results showed no morphological change on the
   spheres, regardless of the iron sorption method employed; however, the
   ultrasound bath drastically decreases the synthesis time from several
   hours to a few minutes (15 min), comparing to the conventional method.
   Response surface methodology and Box-Behnken design were used to
   evaluate the effects of the pH, the mass of Fe photocatalyst and H(2)O(2
   )concentration. 98.8 % removal of the MB occurred at pH = 3, 2 g of

AB Solar photo-Fenton represents an innovative and low-cost option for the
   treatment of recalcitrant industrial wastewater, such as the textile
   wastewater. Textile wastewater usually shows high acute toxic and
   variability and may be composed of many different chemical compounds.
   This study aimed at optimizing and validating solar photo-Fenton
   treatment of textile wastewater in a semi-pilot compound parabolic
   collector (CPC) for toxicity removal and wastewater reclamation. In
   addition, treated wastewater reuse feasibility was investigated through
   pilot tests. Experimental design performed in this study indicated
   optimum condition for solar photo-Fenton reaction (20 mg L-1 of Fe2+ and
   500 mg L-1 of H2O2; pH 2.8), which achieved 96 % removal of dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC) and 99 % absorbance removal. A toxicity peak was
   detected during treatment, suggesting that highly toxic transformation
   products were formed during reaction. Toxic intermediates were properly
   removed during solar photo-Fenton (SPF) treatment along with the
   generation of oxalic acid as an ultimate product of degradation and COS
   increase. Different samples of real textile wastewater were treated in
   order to validate optimized treatment condition with regard to
   wastewater variability. Results showed median organic carbon removal
   near 90 %. Finally, reuse of treated textile wastewater in both dyeing
   and washing stages of production was successful. These results confirm
   that solar photo-Fenton, as a single treatment, enables wastewater
   reclamation in the textile industry.

AB The pollution of water bodies by residual pharmaceuticals is a major
   problem globally. Bismuth tungstate mediated photocatalysis has been
   effective in the removal of these organics from water. Bismuth tungstate
   (Bi2WO6) has proven to be an excellent visible light active
   photocatalyst because of its non-toxicity, low band gap energy and ease
   of preparation. It has been widely applied for the removal of a wide
   array of organic pollutants, particularly dyes, from wastewater.
   However, recently, much attention has been channelled to its application
   for the degradation of pharmaceuticals. In this present review, the
   recent trends in the applications of Bi2WO6 based photocatalysts for the
   removal of pharmaceuticals in wastewater are comprehensively discussed.
   The fabrication of Bi2WO6 based photocatalysts with enhanced
   photocatalytic performances through morphology control, doping and
   formation of heterojunctions are highlighted. Much discussion centres on
   the mechanisms and possible degradation pathways of antibiotic
   pharmaceuticals in wastewater. Finally, areas needing more attention and
   investigation on the use of Bi2WO6 based photocatalysts for removal of
   pharmaceuticals from wastewater especially towards real-life
   applications are presented for future research directions.

AB Mineralization of Acid blue 29 (AB 29), an anionic azo dye, was carried
   out at various pHs using UV254 in the presence of H2O2 (HP) or Na2S2O8
   (SPS) as oxidants. The influence of operational variables such as pH and
   intensity of UV light on mineralization was analyzed and their
   electrical efficiency were evaluated in terms of electrical energy per
   order (EE/O). It was observed that although HP and SPS worked as good
   oxidants at all pHs, mineralization ability of SPS was higher than HP.
   In fact it was noted in general that at a particular time, the
   mineralization increased with increase in intensity, e.g. the
   mineralization by UV/SPS system in 90 min at pH 6.69 (natural pH of AB
   29) increased from 37.9% to 95.6% when the intensity was increased from
   213 to 1755 mu W cm(-2). The most important finding of the work is that
   >95% mineralization was achieved at all pHs except at pH 13, where it
   was 80%. Under the present experimental conditions, SPS showed higher
   biotoxicity removal efficiency (90.2%) than HP (64.6%) after adjusting
   the pH of the treated solution to 7. Thus, we have been able to generate
   eco-friendly effluent, which makes our work suitable for real scale
   applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Coloured wastewater from the textile industry is a very serious global
   problem. Among 16 different white-rot fungal isolates, Trametes hirsuta
   PW17-41 revealed high potential for decolourisation of mixed textile
   dyes (Navy EC-R, Ruby S3B and Super Black G) from real industrial
   wastewater samples. The efficiency of dye decolourisation was evaluated
   using the American Dye Manufacturers' Institute (ADMI) standard
   methodology. The suitable support for fungal mycelium immobilisation was
   nylon sponges. The optimal dye decolourisation (95.39%) was achieved by
   using palm sugar and ammonium nitrate as carbon and nitrogen sources,
   respectively. The initial pH was 5 and the agitation speed was 100 rpm
   at 30 degrees C. The ADMI values of textile dyes decreased from 2475 to
   114 within two days, reducing the treatment time from seven days before
   optimisation. The major mechanism of dye decolourisation was
   biodegradation, which was confirmed by UV-visible and FTIR spectra.
   Manganese peroxidase (MnP) (4942 U L-1) was found to be the main enzyme
   during the decolourisation process at an initial dye concentration of
   21,200 ADMI. The results indicated the strong potential of immobilised
   fungal cells to remove high concentrations of textile dyes from
   industrial wastewater and their potential ability to produce high MnP
   and laccase activities that can be used in further application.

AB The present work demonstrates the fabrication of ZnO loaded on biomass
   porous carbon through pyrolysis of jute fibers pretreated by Zn(OAc)(2).
   XRD, Raman SEM, TEM, XPS and physical adsorption of nitrogen were used
   to characterize the products. Dark adsorption and photocatalytic
   degradation of methylene blue (MB) was run to evaluate their activities
   for removal of organic pollutants. It was demonstrated that the
   composition and structure of ZnO/JFC composites depended on the ratios
   of jute fibers to zinc salt. Through adjusting the mass ratio between
   raw materials, a fine composite of ZnO monocrystalline nanorods embedded
   on the porous carbon walls was obtained, which exhibited a much better
   efficiency for MB decolorization. The removal of MB was found to be pH
   dependent, and the optimized removal efficiency reached to 99% and the
   mineralization level was over 93% at pH 7.0 following 30 min under UV
   illumination. The kinetic studies showed the decolorization of MB
   followed pseudo first-order kinetics, and the rate constants were
   determined using the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model, indicating K-LH = 0.024
   L.mg(-1) and k(c) = 4.01 mg.L-1 min(-1). Moreover, the ZnO nanorods/JFC
   composite was stable and showed a high efficiency of over 80% during
   seven cycles of utilization and regeneration. Examination for the real
   sample contaminated by MB proved that the presence of metal ions and
   other organic pollutants hardly affected its photocatalytic ability. It
   was demonstrated that ZnO/JFC composites could be fabricated through
   simultaneous pyrolysis of jute fibers and zinc acetate. These composites
   were provided with the advantages of high photocatalytic efficiency,
   convenient recycling and long-term stability, and were expected to be
   applied in environmental engineering and manufacturing for organic dyes
   removal.

AB Water-purification membranes with high water flux, excellent recycling
   ability, good anti-fouling property, wide range for different oil/water
   emulsions separation, and strong water-soluble dyes removal ability are
   highly desirable for water purification but still a challenge to be
   realized. In this work, we show a simple method to address this
   challenge, in which halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) have been decorated on
   the poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) membrane surface through one-pot
   method via the aid of KH550 and dopamine. The HNTs@PVDF composite
   membrane exhibits superhydrophilic and under-water superoleophobic
   performance. In addition, our membrane can separate wide oil/water
   emulsions (including surfactant-stabilized and surfactant-free
   emulsions) from wastewater with high efficiency ( > 99.65%), outstanding
   recycle ability with good flux recovery rate (FRR > 95%) and good
   anti-fouling performance (the underwater oil contact angle (OCA) is
   155.8 +/- 1.8 degrees with low oil adhesion) and high water flux (7994
   +/- 150 L m(-2)h(-1)). Interestingly, our membrane also removes
   different water-soluble dyes (e.g., Congo red, methylene blue, and
   rhodamine B) from waste water by simply filtering. Those outstanding
   properties make our membrane hold great potential applications in
   real-world water purification and environmental protection.

   performance of the membranes. Finally, 3 different real wastewater
   treatability tests were carried out and the change in membrane
   performance was observed by using hot textile wastewater. In the coated
   membranes, the pure water flux decreased from 2000 L/(m2.h) to 100
   L/(m2.h) for the ultrafiltration membrane and from about 370 L/(m2.h) to
   23 L/(m2.h) for the tight-ultrafiltration membrane. In the bovine serum
   albumin removal efficiency test, approximately 30 % removal was obtained
   for the ultrafiltration membrane and 100 % for the tight-ultrafiltration
   membrane. In real wastewater filtration tests performed with the
   tightultrafiltration membrane, the average removal efficiency of
   approximately 40 % and above 44 % was obtained for chemical oxygen
   demand and total organic carbon and color removal, respectively.
   Finally, in the hot water test, it was observed that the permeate flux

AB Alkylphenols are industrial pollutants commonly present in wastewater.
   They are difficult to eliminate by conventional treatment processes,
   ending up in the sludge of wastewater treatment plants. In this study,
   we propose to use cross-linked cyclodextrinbased polymers (ECP) as
   sorbents to treat three alkylphenols, namely, one nonylphenol (4-n-NP)
   and two octylphenols (4-n-OP and 4-tert-OP), present in aqueous solution
   by a batch method. The experiments were carried out with five
   cyclodextrin polymers (alpha-ECP, beta-ECP, gamma-ECP,
   alpha,beta,gamma-ECP, and HP-beta-ECP). Sorption results showed that all
   polymers, with the exception of alpha-ECP, had high sorption capacities
   between 60 and 100% of the alkylphenols in the concentration range
   studied (between 25 and 100 mu g/L). In all cases, HP-beta-ECP has shown
   the highest removals, regardless of the structure of the molecule. The
   order obtained was HP-beta-ECP >> beta-ECP similar to
   alpha,beta,gamma-ECP >> gamma-ECP > alpha-ECP. The 4-tert-OP compound
   was the best adsorbed, regardless the material and the solution studied.
   Sorption results also indicated that (i) the sorption efficiency
   decreased with the increasing of alkylphenol concentration; (ii) sodium
   chloride had a strong negative effect on the sorption process; and (iii)
   the performance remained unchanged after five sorption-regeneration
   cycles. The main sorption mechanism of alkylphenols occurring in ECP was
   the inclusion within the cyclodextrin cavities. The obtained results
   proved that cyclodextrin polymers could serve as efficient sorbents for
   the removal of alkylphenols from real effluents.

AB Electrospinning of cellulose acetate with appropriated solvent system is
   the most straightforward method for fabricating micro-and nanofibers. To
   simultaneously and effectively remove both cationic and anionic dyes, a
   novel cost-effective multifunctional cellulose acetate (CA) fibers
   membrane was prepared by electrospinning followed by deacetylation,
   carboxymethylation and polydopamine (PDA) coating. The adsorption
   properties of PDA@DCA-COOH membrane were evaluated with methylene blue
   (MB) and Congo red (CR) as the ionic repre-sentatives for their removal.
   The results indicated that carboxyl, hydroxyl and amine multifunctional
   groups had been successfully grafted on the surface of the nanofibers
   with the maximum adsorption capacities of 69.89 and 67.31 mg g(-1) for
   MB and CR, respectively, in the individual systems. The effect of
   co-existed dyes, inorganic salts and surfactants on the uptake of MB and
   CR in the simulated real complex system was strongly depended on the
   initial pH and ionic strength of the solution. The excellent adsorption
   capacities of the composite membrane were due to strong electrostatic
   attraction through the abundant functional groups on PDA@DCA-COOH
   surface. Based on its excellent recycling performance and adsorption
   property, PDA@DCA-COOH has a promising potential as an effective
   adsorbent in water treatment. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Beside others, textile industries are the major sources of discharging
   huge amount of highly colored wastewater. The objective of this work was
   to study the adsorption of methylene blue (MB), from its aqueous
   solution on Moroccan pozzolana. Adsorption kinetics and isotherms of MB
   have been experimentally studied. The support (adsorbent) was
   characterized by, FTIR, SEM, X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS),
   X-Ray fluorescence, and its Point of Zero Charge (pHPZC) was determined.
   The adsorption data of MB on pozzolana was analyzed using Langmuir,
   Freundlich, Temkin and Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherm models. Based on
   the data fitting and comparison of the correlation coefficient (R-2), it
   is inferred that Langmuir isotherm is most closely followed with a
   maximum adsorption capacity of 43.86 mg g(-1). The kinetic data are well
   described by the pseudo-second order kinetic model with a R-2 value of
   about 0.9997. Finally, the process is used to treat the textile
   wastewater that mainly contains methylene blue. The Pozzolana has shown
   good efficiency in the treatment of real textile wastewater.

AB A new sorbent based on Sepia shells (cuttlefish bones) has been
   synthesized (SSBC) and tested for the sorption of cationic dye (crystal
   violet, CV) and an anionic dye (congo red, CR). SSBC was produced by
   reaction of sepia shells powder with urea in the presence of
   formaldehyde. In the first part of the work, the sorbent was
   characterized using scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive
   X-ray analysis, Fourier-transform infra-red spectrometry and titration
   (for determining pH(PZC)). In a second step, sorption properties were
   tested on the two dyes through the study of pH effect, sorbent dosage,
   temperature and ionic strength; the sorption isotherms and uptake
   kinetics were analyzed at the optimum pH: Langmuir equation fits
   isotherm profiles while the kinetic profile can be described by the
   pseudo-second order rate equation. Maximum sorption capacities reach up
   to 0.536 mmol g(-1) for CV and 0.359 mmol g(-1) for CR, at pH 10.6 and
   2.4, respectively. The comparison of sorption properties at different
   temperatures shows that the sorption is endothermic. Processing to the
   sorption under microwave irradiation (microwaved enforced sorption, MES)
   increases mass transfer and a contact time as low as 1 min is sufficient
   under optimized conditions (exposure time and power) reaching the
   equilibrium, while 2-3 h were necessary for "simple" sorption. Dye
   desorption was successfully tested using 0.5 M solutions of NaOH and HCl
   for the removal of CR and CV, respectively. The sorbent can be re-used
   for a minimum of four cycles of sorption/desorption. Finally, the
   sorbent was successfully tested on spiked tap water and real industrial
   wastewater.

AB BACKGROUND Sonophotocatalysis has gained great attention for research
   into practical applications to treat refractory organic dye from
   wastewater. However, its degradation efficiency needs to be improved
   further. To further enhance the sonophotocatalytic performance, here we
   report a novel hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-assisted titania (TiO2)-based
   sonophotocatalyic system (H2O2-US-UV/TiO2) for degradation of acid
   orange 7 (AO7).
   RESULTS Effects of operating parameters including catalyst dosage,
   concentration of the oxidative agents and initial pH were analyzed
   through a response surface method coupled with Box-Behnken experimental
   design (RSM-BBD) and experiments. Introducing H2O2 into the US-UV/TiO2
   system can significantly enhance AO7 removal. A quadratic model was
   proposed for predicting AO7 degradation using the RSM-BBD method, and
   the statistical significance of the model was confirmed by ANOVA. The
   real AO7 removal efficiency (95.8%) under experimental conditions of 0.5
   g L-1 TiO2, 4 mmol L-1 H2O2, and initial pH 3 was comparable with the
   predicated value (98.6%) obtained from this model. Quenching tests
   revealed that the hydroxyl radical (OH) was the key reactive species in
   the sonophotocatalytic system. Degradation products including
   2-naphthol, 4-carboxylphenylglycine, cinnamic acid and 1,10-Decanediol
   were identified.
   CONCLUSION Adding H2O2 improved the degradation performance of AO7 in
   the US-UV/TiO2 system; H2O2 concentration was a more significant
   experimental factor than initial pH and TiO2 dosage. A degradation
   pathway of AO7 removal was suggested according to results of liquid
   chromatography-mass spectrometry. The novel hybrid H2O2-US-UV/TiO2
   system can be utilized as an efficient process for recalcitrant dye
   wastewater treatment. (c) 2021 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI).

AB Fungal biosorption is an environmental biotechnology based on the
   ability of the fungal cell wall to concentrate harmful water pollutants.
   Among its advantages are its simplicity, high efficiency, flexibility of
   operation, and low cost. The biosorptive performance of fungal pellets
   is getting growing attention since they offer process advantages over
   the culture of disperse mycelia, such as an enhanced biomass separation,
   and a high resilience in severe environmental conditions. In this
   review, biosorption capacity of fungal pellets towards heavy metals,
   dyes, phenolic compounds, humic substances, pesticides, and
   pharmaceuticals was reviewed. Available data about the adsorption
   capacity of pellets, their removal efficiency, and the operational
   conditions used were collected and synthesized. The studies relying on
   biodegradation were discarded to present only the possibilities of
   fungal pellets for removing these concern pollutants through
   biosorption. It was found that the biosorption of complex mixtures of
   pollutants on fungal pellets is scarcely studied, as well as the
   interfering effect of anions commonly found in water and wastewater.
   Furthermore, there is a lack of research with real wastewater and at
   pilot and large scale. These topics need to be further explored to take
   full advantage of fungal pellets on improving the quality of aquatic
   systems.

AB In this paper, Taguchi method was applied to determine the optimum
   operating conditions for textile wastewater treatment by
   electrocoagulation (EC) with iron electrodes. The removal efficiency of
   chemical oxygen demand (COD) and turbidity was considered as the
   performance parameters. L-9 orthogonal array (OA, three factors in three
   levels) was selected as the experimental design for three controllable
   parameters mentioned above. These parameters that mainly affect the EC
   process were specified as initial pH, current density and electrolysis
   time. Each parameter was examined at three levels using Taguchi method.
   Performance analysis was followed by a variance analysis in order to
   determine the optimum levels and relative magnitude of the effect of
   parameters. Taguchi's the larger the better performance formula was
   used. The optimum operating conditions in terms of COD and turbidity
   were found to be initial pH of 7 and 8, current density of 150A/m(2) and
   electrolysis time of 20 and 30min. At the optimum conditions, COD and
   turbidity removal efficiencies were obtained as 42.2 and 99.1%,
   respectively. Operating costs of EC process for COD and turbidity
   removals were calculated as 1.52 and 1.73Euro/m(3). Besides, the UV-Vis
   spectrum was used to detect the changes in textile wastewater quality.
   In EC process, COD concentration of treated effluent was above the
   permitted direct discharge limits. So, active carbon was used to
   increase COD removal efficiency of EC process under the optimum
   operational conditions. COD and turbidity removal efficiencies in the
   EC/activated carbon (AC) process by adding 2,000mg/l AC were 67.9 and
   99.3%, respectively. Operation cost of EC/AC process is calculated as
   1.64Euro/m(3). Besides, the operation costs at different operating
   conditions were also determined.

AB This study investigates the methylene blue adsorption by ryegrass
   by-products. Milled ryegrass straw (Lolium multiflorumLam.), treated
   straw, and the biochar produced from the straw with chemical activation
   with sodium hydroxide solution were used as adsorbent materials. To
   obtain the biochar, the pyrolysis was performed in a tubular reactor
   with nitrogen flow at 623 K. The characterization of all the adsorbents
   was realized analyzing the real density, bulk density, particle
   diameter, proximate analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray
   diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. Kinetic studies and
   adsorption isotherms were evaluated with models fit predicted in the
   literature. The biochar showed a well-developed porous structure. In the
   treated straw, there occurred a degradation of compounds such as
   hemicelluloses and lignin, which gave the modification in the surface of
   the material. For the kinetic studies, the pseudo-first-order,
   pseudo-second-order, and Avrami models presented a good fit. For the
   adsorption isotherms, the Sips model provided the maximum adsorption
   capacity to the milled straw (28.7 mg/g) and treated straw (67.19 mg/g).
   The most promising results were obtained by the treated straw, with high
   efficiency in the removal of the methylene blue dye from the solution,
   reaching values higher than 99%.

AB Marine seaweed is considered as one of the efficient tools for the
   mitigation of carbon dioxide and it is naturally overgrown in India.
   Biochar produced from seaweeds will remediate the toxic pollutants
   present in the soil and wastewater. The current investigation examined
   the potential of biochar synthesized from Ulva reticulata for the
   decolorization of Remazol Brilliant Orange 3 R (RBO3R). An
   up-flow-packed bed column is designed to check the feasibility of the
   effluent treatment in a real wastewater system. The partition
   coefficient was calculated to elucidate the optimal initial RBO3R
   concentration that has the highest affinity toward the biochar and the
   column operating parameters namely sorbent bed depth, flowrate and the
   initial RBO3R concentration were also studied. To validate the
   experimental data mathematical models namely the modified dose-response
   model (MDR) and Yoon Nelson model (YN) were developed. The results
   concluded that the removal efficiency of 69.08% and sorption capacity of
   0.1046 mmol/g was obtained. The biochar potential has been assessed by
   conducting three sorptions and an elution cycle continuously using 0.01
   M sodium hydroxide as the elutant.

AB Lower dye concentrations and the presence of several dyes along with
   other matrices in environmental samples restrict their determination.
   Herein, a highly sensitive and rapid ultra-performance tandem mass
   spectrometric method was developed for simultaneous determination of
   cationic dyes, namely methylene blue (MB), rhodamine B (RB) and crystal
   violet (CV), in environmental samples. To preconcentrate environmental
   samples, solid-phase extraction cartridges were developed by using
   hydrogen peroxide modified pistachio shell biomass (MPSB). The surface
   morphological and chemical functionalities of MPSB were well
   characterized. The developed method was validated considering different
   validation parameters. In terms of accuracy and precision, the %RSD for
   all three dyes at all four concentration points was found to be between
   1.26 and 2.76, while the accuracy reported in terms of the recovery was
   found to be 98.02%-101.70%. The recovery was found to be in the range of
   98.11% to 99.55%. The real sample analysis shows that MB, RB, and CV
   were found in the ranges of 0.39-5.56, 0.32-1.92 and 0.27-4.36 mu g/mL,
   respectively.

AB BACKGROUND: An immobilized new biosorbent was prepared from macro fungi
   Lactarius salmonicolor for the effective removal of nickel ions from
   aqueous media. Operating conditions were optimized as functions of
   initial pH, agitation time, sorbent amount and dynamic flow rate.
   Immobilization and biosorption mechanism were examined and the developed
   biosorbent was tested for the removal of nickel ions from real
   wastewater. RESULTS: Biosorption performance of the biomass continuously
   increased in the pH range 2.08.0. The coverage of the biosorbent surface
   by silica gel resulted in a significant increase in biosorption yield of
   nickel ions. The highest nickel loading capacity was obtained as 114.44
   mg g1 using a relatively small amount of immobilized biosorbent.
   Biosorption equilibrium time was recorded as 5 min. Experimental data
   were analyzed by different isotherm and kinetic models. Infrared
   spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray energy dispersive
   analysis confirmed the process. The sorbent exhibited relatively good
   recovery potential in dynamic flow mode studies. Biosorption capacity of
   immobilized biosorbent was noted as 14.90 mg g1 in real wastewater.
   CONCLUSION: Silica gel immobilized biomass of L. salmonicolor is to be a
   low cost and potential biosorbent with high biosorption capacity for the
   removal of contaminating nickel from aqueous media. (c) 2012 Society of

AB The release of toxic dyes from different industries through industrial
   effluents cause hazardous effects to human and aquatic life. Therefore,
   the detoxification of such toxic pollutants is very important for a
   clean environment. In this regard, chitosan conjugated Mn-magnetic
   nano-biocomposite (Mn-CCMN) was synthesized, characterized, and applied
   for the photocatalytic decontamination of crystal violet (CV) dye in the
   contaminated aqueous system and industrial wastewater. The
   characterization was performed using SEM, XRD, EDX and FTIR
   spectroscopic techniques and determine PZC. The data shows the
   successfully synthesis of the resultant nano-biocomposite with amorphous
   nature and Fe and Mn were present therein. The SEM study revealed the
   flat and irregular shaped structure with porous surface and 87 & PLUSMN;
   4 nm as mean particle size. The application of as- synthesized
   nano-biocomposite was determined as a photocatalyst for the eradication
   of CV in the aqueous environment under UV light illumination. The
   different photocatalysis conditions were studied for maximum degradation
   of CV and under the best experimental factors, tremendous CV degradation
   was attained in the real samples and industrial wastewater. The
   synthesized Mn-CCMN sustain excellent photocatalytic performance for
   four successive batches. The photocatalytic data was fitted to the
   pseudo-first-order kinetic model (R2 = 0.992) having 0.007672 min-1 and
   0.0549 ppm/min as k and reaction rate, respectively. The statistical
   models such as response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural
   network-genetic algorithm (ANN-GA) were also applied for confirmation of
   the experimental data and the results showed a good agreement. It is
   deduced that the synthesized Mn-CCMN could be an excellent alternative
   to the present photocatalysts for the decontami-nation of toxic organic
   dyes from contaminated water and industrial wastewater.

   properties and the adsorption process, and the mechanisms involved in
   adsorption are discussed in this review. Though the adsorption
   capacities are high for the composites studied, partition coefficient
   which suggest the per-formance of composites remain low for most
   adsorbents. Despite the recent progress in the synthesis of LDHs-biochar

AB The performance of batch electrocoagulation-flotation (ECF) process
   using aluminum (Al) and iron (Fe) electrodes with monopolar
   configuration was investigated. The effect of several operational
   parameters (initial pH, current density, initial NaCl concentration and
   operating time) on the removal efficiency of chemical oxygen demand
   (COD) from real urban wastewater was studied. At optimum conditions
   (initial pH of 5 and 7, current density of 20mA.cm(-2), NaCl
   concentration of 2 g.L-1 and electrolysis time of 6 minutes), COD
   removal from urban wastewater containing 1000 mg.L-1 was found to be 84%
   and 80% using Al and Fe electrodes, respectively. The operating cost at
   optimum conditions was calculated as 0.80 $.Kg(-1) and 0.82 $.Kg(-1)
   using Al and Fe electrodes, respectively. It can be concluded that COD
   removal using Al electrode is as effective and low cost as using Fe
   electrodes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, two bioadsorbents were developed by the pyrolysis from
   orange peel waste at 500 degrees C and 700 degrees C, respectively. Both
   biochars were characterized and evaluated for the treatment of a real
   raw textile industry wastewater from Medellin-Colombia. Additionally,
   the pollutant removal efficiency of synthesized biochars was compared
   with a commercial activated carbon (CAC). Synthetized materials showed
   no important variations between them in terms of chemical composition,
   morphology, structure, and textural properties. The maximum removal
   percentages for color, chemical oxygen demand, biochemical oxygen demand
   and total organic carbon were found be 32%, 30%, 68% and 52%,
   respectively, for the biochar obtained at 700 degrees C under optimal
   conditions (100 mg of biochar at 25 degrees C and pH of 3.0). The
   removal percentages for the same parameters under similar adsorption
   conditions were 22%, 15%, 14% and 27%, respectively, using the CAC. It
   is noticed that all values are smaller than those achieved with the
   bioadsorbents produced in this study. Thus, bioadsorbents from orange
   peel waste could be an alternative low-cost material for treatment of
   real raw textile industry wastewater.

AB Pollutants derived from real textile wastewater present a high
   environmental risk. This work involves the study of the removal of
   chemical oxygen demand (COD), color, and turbidity from Tunisian real
   textile wastewater by two different water treatment technologies:
   chemical coagulation (CC) and electrocoagulation (EC). A comparative
   study between these two methods was conducted based on the separation
   performance and operating cost (OC). The effects of different
   operational parameters including electrolysis time (t), voltage, and pH
   for EC and the coagulant concentration, initial pH, and time of slow
   mixing (t(sm)) for CC were studied using response surface methodology.
   The developed quadratic models for the responses were in good agreement
   with the experimental data. The experiments proved the efficiency of
   both chemical and electrochemical techniques for the treatment of
   textile effluent. Indeed, by using EC, the reduction efficiencies of
   COD, color, and turbidity were 63.05, 99.07, and 96.31%, respectively,
   under optimal conditions (pH 9, t = 36.26 min, and voltage 4 V). For CC
   treatment, the achieved removal efficiencies of COD, color, and
   turbidity were 54.02, 96.21, and 93.7%, respectively, at pH 8.57, a
   coagulant concentration of 204.75 mg/L, and a t(sm) of 28.41 min as
   optimal operating conditions. The OC obtained for EC and CC was about
   0.47 and 0.2 USD/m(3), respectively. Even if the OC of the EC process
   was higher as compared to the CC process, the treated water obtained by
   EC meets the Tunisian Standards (NT 106.03 and NT 09-14) for textile
   wastewater discharge into the environment and demonstrates a high
   potential for its reuse in various industrial activities. EC technology
   can be integrated into a wastewater management system that ensures a
   zero liquid discharge of wastewater into the environment.

AB In order to manage water resources in countries with water crisis,
   recycling of water in houses can be a practical strategy. The usage of
   advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) is an efficient way when a low
   volume of wastewater is considered. In this work, a real washing machine
   effluent (WME) was treated by four electrochemical advanced oxidation
   processes. Electro-Fenton (EF) and photoelectro-Fenton (PEF) processes
   are combined with peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to treat WME. Heterogeneous
   iron-based catalyst (Fe3O4, MNPs) was synthesized as catalyst for all
   processes. The characteristics of MNPs were determined by several
   techniques. All operating parameters were investigated for EF, PEF,
   EF/PMS and PEF/PMS. PEF/PMS process removed nearly complete organic
   compounds (99.5% of chemical oxygen demand and 97.1% of total organic
   carbon) under the conditions of pH = 5.0, 30 mA/cm(2), MNPs = 100 mg/L,
   2 mM PMS and 180 min reaction time. MNPs function was without change
   after three times usage. The results indicated that PEF/PMS can be a new
   system for treatment of effluents such as greywater, washing machine
   etc. for the application in household scale to reduce water consumption.

AB The industrial revolution has led to an unequal and uncontrolled
   distribution of the toxic substances in different environmental
   compartments. A large number of researchers have offered specific
   solu-tion to combat the hazardous and toxic substances. The real
   challenge faced today is the complex interaction of the pollutants in
   each compartment compelling the scientists to develop materials offering
   one spot solution applicable to a wide range of toxicants. In the
   present research, zeolite as base material is synthesized from
   economical precursors using hydrothermal method. Post modification for
   synthesis of functionalized hybrids is attempted with doping of metals
   (Cu, Zn). The purpose of preparation of hybrids is to have diverse
   functional groups on the surface of a sin-gle zeolite to adsorb a
   variety of pollutants from environmental media. The synthesized
   materials are subjected to a series of characterization techniques
   [Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction
   (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy/
   Energy-dispersive X-ray (SEM/EDX)] to determine surface and bulk
   properties for effective adsorp-tion. The successful incorporation of
   metal-oxygen is indicated by FTIR. SEM analysis proposes that crevices
   and channels serve as pores for uptake of incoming pollutants. Further,
   EDX shows silica and alumina percentage which is involved in developing
   zeolite framework (internal and external linkages) for binding. The
   thermal stability of zeolite (360 degrees C-570 degrees C) is assessed
   from TGA studies. XRD demonstrates the amorphous nature of zeolite
   framework that generally decreases on func-tionalization. Zeolite and
   the functionalized hybrids are applied for the removal of metals (Hg,
   As), dyes (Methylene blue, Methyl orange). Generally, mercury showed
   better removal than arsenic on the adsorbents. Moreover all zeolite
   based hybrids testifies the fitness of pseudo-second-order kinetics and
   Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms for the removal of mercury and
   arsenic.

AB The global water pollution is caused by the increase of industrial and
   agricultural activities, which have produced various toxic pollutants.
   Pollutants in water generally consist of metal ions, pharmaceuticals and
   personal care products (PPCPs), oil spills, organic dyes, and other
   organic pollutants. Amongst the adsorbents that have been developed to
   deal with pollutants in water, Zr-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)
   have drawn scientists' great attention due to their excellent stability
   and adjustable functionalization. Herein, the present review article
   introduces the synthetic methods of functionalized Zr-based MOFs and
   summarizes their applications in water pollution treatment. It also
   clarifies the interactions and removal mechanisms between pollutants and
   Zr-based MOFs. The use of these MOFs with eminent adsorption ability and
   recycling performance have been discussed in detail. Zr-based MOFs also
   face some challenges such as high cost, lack of real water environment
   applications, selective removal of pollutants, and low ability to remove
   composite pollutants. Future research should focus on addressing these
   issues. Although there is still a blank of the practical utility of
   Zr-based MOFs on a commercial scale, the research reported to date
   clearly shows that they are very promising materials for the water
   treatment. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In an attempt to overcome such threats posed by water pollution, various
   processes ranging from physical, chemical as well as biological were
   applied to get rid of wastewater pollutants. The simplicity, high
   efficiency and cheapness of an adsorption process make it the most
   widely used among various other processes. Adsorbents with different
   properties were used in the adsorption process but this paper was
   focused on reviewing various articles published by numerous researchers
   on the isolation of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), a popular
   carbohydrate polymer from lignocellulosic biomass and utilization of MCC
   based materials as effective adsorbents for the successful removal of
   dyes and heavy metals from synthetic wastewater. The sudden interest on
   MCC and MCC-based materials as adsorbents cannot be separated from their
   excellent properties such as renewability, biodegradability,
   biocompatibility, economic value, non-toxicity, high mechanical
   properties and surface area. Upon comparison with established adsorbents
   reported from literature, MCC-based materials performed excellently well
   in the adsorption of dyes and heavy metals with Langmuir isotherm and
   pseudo-second order reported mostly as the best fit models for the
   generated equilibrium and kinetic data, respectively pointing at the
   distribution of adsorption sites to be homogeneous as well as the
   formation of monolayer adsorbate on their surfaces. The various
   thermodynamic studies reported further revealed the adsorption processes
   of both dyes and heavy metals onto MCC-based materials to be entropy
   driven processes, spontaneous, and endothermic. Finally, future research
   was suggested to focus on optimization to enhance the performance of the
   MCC-based adsorbents, carrying out the adsorption on real wastewater
   instead of synthetic ones as well as expanding the range of adsorbates
   to include other contaminants such as chlorophenols, herbicides,
   pesticides and others in addition to dyes and heavy metals. (C) 2019

AB Millions of people worldwide are compelled to consume water with high
   arsenic levels that affect their health adversely. This point intrigued
   the researchers to develop an effective and economical solution to
   reduce the high arsenic level to the safe standard limits. This research
   focuses on the adsorptive removal of arsenate ions onto a novel bimetal
   oxide particle prepared by mixing Zn and Sn at different atomic ratios.
   The fabricated bimetallic oxides were characterised by applying various
   techniques such as XRD, SEM-EDX, BET and FTIR to comprehend the
   morphology and physico-chemical properties. Batch adsorption experiments
   were conducted to monitor the arsenate removal under varying process
   variables such as pH, dosage, contact time etc. The investigation
   revealed that Zn/Sn bimetal oxide particles prepared with atomic ratio
   2:1 showed maximum arsenate removal efficiency compared to other atomic
   ratios. The removal was found to be pH, dose and temperature dependent
   and the highest removal of 98.8% was observed at pH 4 with 0.125 g/L of
   adsorbent dose with an initial dye concentration of 2.5 ppm at 45
   degrees C. Kinetic study and isotherm study of the sorption experiment
   showed that the pseudo-second order model and Langmuir isotherm model
   were best suited for the adsorption of arsenate ion the prepared Zn/Sn
   bimetal oxide adsorbent. The maximum adsorption capacity of the
   adsorbent computed as 41.29 mg/g at 318K. A regeneration study revealed
   that 0.1 M phosphoric acid showed 96% desorption of adsorbate. The
   practical applicability of the Zn/Sn bimetal oxide was also explored to
   evaluate the performance in real condition.

AB Electrochemical technologies are a promising alternative for the
   treatment of wastewaters containing organic pollutants. The main
   advantages of these processes include environmental compatibility,
   versatility, energy efficiency, safety, selectivity, amenability to
   automation and cost effectiveness. However, the effectiveness of the
   electrochemical approaches depends strongly on electrode materials and
   cell parameters (mass transport, current density, water composition,
   etc.). Then, the use of high performance anodic materials can achieve
   high efficiency and lower the operating cost. Therefore, several
   research groups are recently studying the applicability of the
   electrochemical technologies for treating real domestic and industrial
   effluents, with the aim of that a diversification of techniques must be
   sought, adapting the treatment to each situation, as much as possible.
   In this context, this paper presents an overview of the application of
   electrochemical technologies to treat industrial effluents in the
   northeastern region of Brazil, emphasizing the use of direct and
   indirect electrochemical oxidation processes as an alternative to
   pollution abatement of effluents generated by textile and petrochemical
   industries.

AB Here we describe the integration of spherical and rod-liked Fe-0/iron
   oxides nanopartides into polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) polymeric
   microcapsule via phase inversion technique. This synthesis technique
   allows the encapsulation of Fe-0/iron oxides nanoparticles, with both
   magnetic and catalytic properties, into PVDF polymeric microcapsule
   which further enhances its pollutant removal efficiency through two
   mechanisms: entrapment by polymeric network, follow with catalytic
   degradation by nanoparticles. A model system by using methylene blue
   (MB) as targeted pollutant was employed to test the feasibility of this
   idea. By having the magnetic nanopartides within the PVDF microcapsule
   has at least boost the capability to remove MB by a factor of three
   compared to freely suspended nanoparticles and recorded a removal
   efficiency of similar to 80 mg/g-microcapsule. After subjected to five
   cycles of M B removal, the nanoparticle augmented microcapsules are
   still retaining more than similar to 90% of their initial performance
   while the PVDF-only microcapsule loses its MB removal capability after
   the first cycle. The successful surface functionalization of magnetic
   nanoparticles was characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and
   electrophoretic mobility measurement. The effects of surface
   functionalization of magnetic nanoparticles on the MB removal are
   interpreted in terms of the particle-pollutant electrostatic
   interaction, and the colloidal stability of the particles before its
   encapsulation into the polymeric network Both nanorod-PVDF and
   nanosphere-PVDF microcapsules retained their magnetic properties after
   MB removal and can be magnetophoretically collected in real time by a

AB Biosorptive treatment of contaminated solutions with different
   biomaterials has been extensively studied in recent years. However,
   application of the suggested biosorbents in industrial scale has been
   very limited so far. Real wastewater conditions play an important role
   in the commercial success of the biosorption process. This study
   describes the potential use of Thamnidium elegans (T. elegans) cells for
   the biosorptive treatment of real industrial wastewater. Biosorption
   mechanism was characterized by zeta potential, Brunauer, Emmett and
   Teller (BET), Infrared (IR) spectrometry, Atomic force microscopy (AFM)
   and elemental analysis. A quadratic model was built for the batch
   process and optimum values of variables were recorded as pH 2.0,
   biosorbent amount: 0.06 g and contact time: 39.3 min with the removal
   yield of 99.42%. Isotherm studies indicated that the process follows the
   Langmuir model. Relatively fast decolorization (40 min) process was well
   described by the pseudo-second-order kinetics. Conversely, the
   biosorbent exhibited high biosorption efficiency (97.55%) in continuous
   mode. In addition to high batch biosorption capacity (288.08 mg g(-1))
   of the biosorbent, another impressive aspect of this study, even after
   ten regeneration cycles, is high biosorption yield (95%). Consequently,
   T. elegans cells showed great potential for the treatment of colored
   real wastewaters. (C) 2016 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published

AB This paper describes the removal of toxic ammonium ions from model and
   real water samples using nanographene sheets (NGs). NGs were
   characterized by using a scanning electron microscope, a transmission
   electron microscope, X-ray diffraction, and surface area analysis. The
   results showed that NGs exist as plate-like overlapped transparent
   wrinkled sheets of graphene with different dimensions and characterized
   with high Brunauer-Emmett-Teller specific surface area. The effect of
   different experimental conditions, NGs mass, removal time, solution
   temperature, and ionic strength, affecting the removal efficiency of
   NH4+ by NGs from synthetic water sample, was studied and optimized. The
   adsorption experiments showed that NGs could remove most of the ammonium
   ions within few minutes, with adsorption capacity of 11.6 mg of NH4+/g
   of NGs at ambient conditions. The removal of ammonium ions on NGs was
   explored kinetically and thermodynamically, and the results revealed the
   suitability of the pseudo-second-order kinetic model for describing the
   adsorption process. Also, the adsorption process was spontaneous,
   exothermic in nature, and negative entropy change indicated the decrease
   in the degree of freedom at the solid-liquid interface. The
   applicability of the NGs for the adsorption of ammonium ions was
   explored using different real environmental water samples, and the
   results indicated that the NGs have great potential to remove ammonium
   ions from aqueous solution.

AB BACKGROUNDAntibiotics have been identified as significant pollutants
   owing to their adverse impact on the environment through the development
   of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. In a previous study, an e-waste-based
   reduced graphene oxide-V2O5-platinum (RGOV-Pt(1%)) nanocomposite was
   prepared and subsequently used for the photocatalytic degradation of
   oxytetracycline (OTC), a tetracycline group of antibiotics.
   RESULTSThis study aimed to assess the impact of additives such as H2O2,
   NaCl, Na2CO3, ethanol and persulfate on the photocatalytic degradation
   of OTC using RGOV-Pt(1%) nanocomposite. The results showed that the
   degradation efficiency decreased in the presence of NaCl and Na2CO3
   owing to the electron-hole scavenging property of their anions. Low
   concentrations of H2O2 (up to 10mmolL(-1)) increased the OTC degradation
   efficiency, whereas high concentrations decreased the OTC degradation
   owing to the quenching of hydroxyl radicals. However, the presence of
   persulfate increased the OTC degradation efficiency owing to the
   formation of hydroxyl radicals. Furthermore, the OTC degradation pathway
   was elucidated using high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass
   spectrometry (HPLC/MS/MS). The study was extended to real pharmaceutical
   effluent and the degradation efficiency was found to be less for real
   effluent (87%) in comparison with OTC (99%) in aqueous solution.
   CONCLUSIONRGOV-Pt(1%) photocatalyst effectively degraded OTC. An OTC
   degradation pathway was proposed based on the intermediates formed. The
   impact of additives was established. Effective real pharmaceutical
   effluent detoxification was observed. Thus the synthesized RGOV-Pt(1%)
   nanocomposite is a hopeful alternative for the removal of antibiotics in
   contaminated waters and sites. (c) 2019 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Diclofenac (DCF), naproxen (NPX) and ibuprofen (IBF) are three of the
   most commonly used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
   worldwide. They are widely detected in natural waters due to their
   persistence in wastewater treatment, and their removal is desirable in
   future wastewater management worldwide. In this study, "acid catalyst"
   functionalisation and subsequent carbonisation were adopted to
   synthesise a P-doped microporous carbonous adsorbent (CScPA) for NSAID
   removal. The CScPA was evaluated in depth for its adsorption performance
   (i.e., isotherms, kinetics and thermodynamics of adsorption at
   lab-scale). The CScPA had a large surface area (791.1 m(2)/g) and good
   porosity (0.392 cm(3)/g), which facilitated a high maximum adsorption
   capacity of 62.02 mg/g for a NSAID mixture. Thermodynamic data indicated
   that the adsorption of these NSAIDs was an endothermic process
   determined by physisorption (low-energy interactions). XPS analysis
   revealed the specific interactions involved in the adsorption process,
   including pi-pi and pi-pi electron donor-acceptor (EDA) interactions and
   hydrogen (H-) bonding. The Freundlich isotherm and Elovich kinetic model
   provided the best fit to the experimental results, which indicated
   surface heterogeneity (of the CScPA) and cooperative adsorption
   mechanisms. The adsorption process was shown to have potential to be
   applied to real wastewater effluent containing NSAIDs at low
   environmentally relevant concentrations (removal reached > 90% at 10 mu
   g/L). Analysis of different implementation and cost related factors
   suggested that the CScPA has the potential for use with "real-world"
   water matrices, offering a sustainable treatment process for
   pharmaceutical remediation in wastewater. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB To date, a wide range of synthetic and real effluents have been treated
   using in situ electrochemically driven BDD-SO42-/SO4 center dot-/S2O82-
   systems to eliminate persistent organic pollutants and microorganisms.
   Although reactive sulfate-based species are electrochemically generated
   in situ with free heterogenous (OH)-O-center dot radicals, SO42-/SO4
   center dot-/S2O82- species have a half-life greater than that of the
   (OH)-O-center dot radicals. However, no information has been published
   regarding the properties of the oxidant solution after its
   electrochemical synthesis. Here, an electrochemical BDD-SO42-/SO4 center
   dot-/S2O82- system was evaluated in terms of solution oxidation power as
   a function of storage temperature, storage time, and ex situ
   applicability. Results clearly show that storage temperature has an
   influence on the storage and service-life of the solutions called
   fresh-persulfate (25 degrees C) or cold-persulfate (10 degrees C).
   Greater stability in the cold-persulfate solution was observed, as a
   function of time, and it was effective in degrading organic pollutants
   as an ex situ oxidation approach, eliminating 80.73%, 79.25%, and 63.25%
   after 120 min for methyl orange dye, 1,4-benzoquinone (1,4-BQ), and
   caffeine, respectively. Cold-persulfate solution also proved to be a
   feasible off-grid technology after 14 days storage. These results
   contribute to understanding of the fundamentals of sulfate aqueous
   solutions as precursors of sulfate-based oxidizing solutions and their
   applications. (C) 2022 The Electrochemical Society ("ECS"). Published on

AB Sediment microbial fuel cells (SMFCs) have been intensively investigated
   for the harvest of energy from natural sediment, but studies of their
   application for wastewater treatment mainly occurred in the past 2-3
   years. SMFCs with simple structures can generate electrical energy while
   decontaminating wastewater. Most SMFCs used for wastewater treatment
   contain plants to mimic constructed wetlands. Both synthetic and real
   wastewaters have been used as substrates in SMFCs that achieved
   satisfactory performance in organic removal. SMFCs have also been scaled
   up from several litres to more than 150 L. To further develop this
   technology, identification of a suitable application niche is needed.
   Several challenges must be addressed, including more detailed analysis
   in energy production, consumption, and application, understanding the
   relationship between electricity generation and contaminant removal,
   selecting plants that will benefit electrode reactions, improving
   nutrients removal, and optimizing system configuration and operation.
   The potential applications of SMFCs for wastewater treatment include
   powering sensors to monitor treatment processes and enhancing the
   removal of specific contaminants by electricity generation.

AB The decolorization of Congo red (CR) in aqueous solution is investigated
   in a batch mode using termite mound as an adsorbent. Elemental analysis
   and identification of the mineral composition/phases in the termite
   mound sample is carried out by means of X-ray fluorescence and X-ray
   diffraction. The optimal percentage removal and equilibrium adsorption
   capacity of CR by the termite mound achieved is found to be 95.68% and
   2.30 mg g(-1) respectively, when 0.5 g of termite mound is added to 30
   mL of 40 mg L-1 CR for 60 min(-1) at 400 rpm. The decolorization of CR
   increases with an increase in the termite mound dosage, contact time,
   stirring speed, pH, and temperature; however, the adsorption capacity
   decreases with an increase in the initial CR concentration. The
   adsorption process shows that CR obeys the Freundlich adsorption model
   with a 0.9355 coefficient of regression, denoting multilayer formation
   onto the termite mound. The adsorption kinetics follow the
   pseudo-second-order model with a coefficient of regression value of
   0.9966, showing that chemisorption is the main rate limiting step. Delta
   G is negative, an indication that the adsorption of CR onto termite
   mound is spontaneous. Approximately 86.6% chemical oxygen demand
   reduction is achieved with real textile wastewater. This study shows how
   termite mound can be harnessed for the treatment of textile wastewater
   before discharged into the environment.

AB Cr6+ and Pb2+ are both highly toxic pollutants and commonly co-exist in
   some industrial effluents and contaminated waters. In this study,
   simultaneous removal of Cr6+ and Pb2+ by a novel sewage sludge-derived
   biochar immobilized nanoscale zero-valent iron (SSB-nZVI) was
   systematically investigated. It was well demonstrated that a porous
   structure was successfully formed on the SSB nZVI when the starch was
   used as an additive. A synergistic effect on the adsorption and
   reduction over the SSB-nZVI was achieved, resulting in nearly 90 and 82%
   of Cr6+ and Pb2+ removal within 30 min, respectively. Cr6+ was reduced
   prior to Pb2+. A low pH could accelerate the corrosion of nZVI as well
   as phosphate leaching. When Malachite green was added as a coexisting
   organic pollutant, its effective removal was found due to the formation
   of a Fenton-like system. The SSB-nZVI could be run consecutively three
   times with a relatively satisfactory performance. Most of Cr6+ was
   converted into Cr2O3 and Cr(OH)(3) on the SSB nZVI surface, whereas most
   of Pb2+ species existed as Pb(OH)(2) (or PbO). A possible reaction
   mechanism on the SSB-nZVI involved the adsorption, reduction and
   precipitation of both Cr6+ and Pb2+ over the particles. Present study
   sheds light on the insight of the fate and transport of Cr6+ and Pb2+ in
   aquatic environment, as well provides helpful guide for the remediation
   of coexistence of pollutants in real applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier

AB Microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) devices are efficient for wastewater
   treatment, but its application was limited due to low anode oxidation
   rate. The objective of this study was to improve anode performance of a
   MEC combined anaerobic reactor (R1) for high concentration industrial
   wastewater treatment via dosing Fe(OH)(3). For the first 53 days without
   power, the addition of Fe(OH)(3) in R1 enhanced the degradation of
   reactive brilliant red X-3B dye and sucrose. Applying a voltage of 0.8 V
   in R1 resulted in a higher decolorization and COD removal through
   driving the redox reactions at electrodes under Fe(III)-reducing
   conditions. Real-time PCR and enzyme activity analysis showed that the
   abundance and azoreductase activity of bacteria were improved in RI.
   Pyrosequencing revealed that dominant populations in anode biofilm and
   R1 were more diverse and abundant than the common anaerobic reactor
   (R2), and there was a significant distinction among anode film, R1 and
   R2 in microbial community structure. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB This study evaluated for the first time the performance and the membrane
   fouling behavior of a laboratory-scale electro-membrane bioreactor
   (EMBR) for the treatment of real textile wastewater. The EMBR was
   operated initially with no electrocoagulation process (control period)
   during 30 days (run I), and thereafter, the electrocoagulation was
   started, using the electrical current density of 10 A m(-2) (run II) and
   15 A m(-2) (run III). The reactor performance on color removal was
   significantly improved by electrocoagulation process, attaining average
   efficiency of 50 and 70% in the experimental runs II and III. Similarly,
   the nitrification performance also was enhanced during the period with
   electrocoagulation, enabling an average NH4+-N removal efficiencies
   above 90% in the runs II and III. Activity batch assays have shown that
   autotrophic biomass exhibited a higher oxygen uptake rate during the
   electrocoagulation experiments, indicating that nitrifying activity
   increased in the EMBR over this period. Despite the substantial
   variation in the influent COD values, the COD removal efficiencies were
   practically constant (75-77%) throughout experimental period. This
   behavior indicates that the reactor exhibited a great resistance to
   shock loading, an important feature for the treatment of industrial
   wastewaters. Better mixed liquor filterability conditions were found
   during the electric current application, resulting in a lower membrane
   fouling rate and demanding a lower frequency of the membrane chemical
   cleaning process.

AB The creation of a polymeric hydrogel from polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)
   cross-linked by Carbon Quantum Dots (CD) for the adsorption and
   photocatalytic degradation of both cationic and anionic dyes. PVP, an
   important biocompatible constituent and often surplus in cosmetic
   industry, was carboxylated through NaOH refluxing and covalently
   conjugated to surface amine functionality of CD derived from lemon juice
   and Cysteamine. The hybrid hydrogel was obtained from PVP-CD covalent
   conjugate by careful manipulation of pH and found to possess better
   rheological properties than only carboxylate-PVP. The monolayer
   physisorption of the dyes on the hydrogel was affected by hydrogen
   bonding, dispersion or inductive effect, and Tc-Tc interaction with the
   polymer backbone as well as the CD that followed pseudo-second-order
   kinetics. Degradation of the adsorbed dyes was instated by the unique
   Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) generating ability of the CD embedded in
   the hydrogel matrix upon exposure to sunlight, the mechanism of which is
   also unveiled. The same CD-induced ROS was found to effectively
   annihilate both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in real
   polluted water in less than 10 min of photoexcitation of the hydrogel.
   The hydrogel was restored by mild acid wash that is able to perform dye
   adsorption and photo-degradation upto four cycles.

AB Hydrophobic aerogels were used to remove three types of persistent
   organic pollutants: pharmaceutical drugs (i.e. doxorubicin [DOX],
   paclitaxel [TAX]), phthalates (diethyl phthalate [DEP]), and hydrophilic
   rhodamine dye (RhB) from synthetic and real wastewaters, using Lumira
   granular aerogel from Cabot activated with EtOH (ET-GAG). The
   hydrophobic silica aerogel was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD),
   High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM),
   Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) and attenuated total reflection-Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy. The pollutants were analysed by
   high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-UV and HPLC-mass
   spectrometry. The adsorption process was governed by hydrophobic-
   hydrophobic interactions between the ET-GAG and micropollutants. The
   adsorption capacity of ET-GAG, examined by batch experiments, for DOX,
   TAX and DEP were 13.80, 14.28 and 17.54 mg/g respectively. The rate of
   adsorption to ET-GAG is high in the initial 40 min followed by no change
   in the rate due to saturation of adsorption sites. ET-GAG was able to
   completely remove micropollutants from real leachate and hospital
   wastewater, implying practical applications. Regeneration of the aerogel
   was studied by solvent extraction. Et-GAG adsorbent demonstrated better
   removal of toxic chemotherapeutic drugs and phthalates than GAC.

AB BACKGROUND This work explored a complete evolutionary process, from
   discovering a new reaction and synthesizing a new crosslinker
   intermediate, to product application in the purification of dyeing
   wastewater. RESULTS A new micro-polycondensation reaction between
   propylacryloyloxypropyldimethylamine and epichlorohydrin was first
   observed, forming a new polyunsaturated cationic crosslinker (poly
   (2-hydroxypropylacryloyloxypropyldimethylammonium chloride) (PHPAC),
   abbreviating HPAC unit as the repeating unit); meanwhile, this new PHPAC
   crosslinker was just a critical modifier of a polycationic flocculant.
   When the thimbleful of PHPAC crosslinkers containing only 0.2% molar
   percentage of HPAC units were incorporated into a polycationic skeleton
   of poly (acryloyloxyethyltrimethylammonium chloride) (PDAC), the
   application properties of the obtained modified product (known as
   SC-PDAC) were greatly improved compared to the unmodified product of
   PDAC. The cost for preparing the modified product of SC-PDAC was hardly
   increased because the quantity of HPAC modifier used was minimal. The
   multi-dimension flocculation interactions of SC-PDAC with the anionic
   dyes allowed the SC-PDAC to realize a more efficient purification of
   dyeing wastewater than the unmodified PDAC. The obtained SC-PDAC could
   remove 99.10% of the dyes Reactive Scarlet 3BS and 96.69% of the dyes
   Methyl Blue when used for purifying the dyeing wastewater. In real
   engineering applications, the further complex interactions of SC-PDAC
   with certain inorganic flocculants and coagulant aids would allow the
   flocs to be quickly formed, condensed, and aggregated, so as to realize
   a fast purification of dyeing wastewater within 10 s. The successful
   implementation of a simulation amplification experiment for treating a
   4.0 L dye solution further confirmed that the SC-PDAC had good potential
   to be applied in real water treatment engineering. CONCLUSIONS
   Therefore, as expected, it could be regarded as an economic and facile
   modification way to obtain the efficient organic cationic flocculant by
   selecting the PHPAC crosslinker as a critical modifier. (c) 2021 Society

AB This study reports an effective method for preparing oxygenated helical
   carbon impregnated chitosan-based loose nanofiltration membrane,
   cross-linked with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) for selective solute
   permeation and various industrial wastewater treatment. The structural
   and functional properties of as prepared thin-film composite (TFC)
   membranes were thoroughly characterized using ATR-IR, FE-SEM, contact
   angle, and zeta potential measurements. Performance testing using
   various feed streams under different testing conditions revealed that
   the optimized membrane showed >90.0% rejection for dyes (both cationic
   and anionic) and humic acid, and <8.0% rejection for MgSO4 with
   40.0-60.0 L.m(-2).h(-1) flux at 3 bar operating pressure. The study was
   extended using four different real industrial wastewaters as feed
   solutions. In all cases, the rejection values for salts resembled with
   that of simulated wastewater with significant removal of organic
   pollutants (reduced COD, BOD and TOC). Thereafter, long term (>100 h)
   studies were conducted using simulated wastewater spiked with multiple
   foulants as feed constituents and the results showed >90.0% rejection
   for organic matters and foulants with a long-term stable flux profile.
   The membranes were stable even after repeated operating cycles without
   any significant reduction in flux or rejection, demonstrating their
   potential to be used as an effective pre-treatment media for various
   industrial wastewaters.

AB Polyaniline-iron(ii) nitrate was prepared by the polymerization of
   aniline hydrochloride with Fe(NO3)(2). The as-prepared materials were
   characterized for surface area and pore volume and were used to remove
   the reactive orange 16 (RO16) dye from an aqueous solution. Batch
   studies were conducted as a function of pH (2-12), adsorbent amount
   (10-100 mg), initial RO16 concentration (100-300 mg L-1), contact time
   (10-240 min), and temperature (303-323 K). RO16 was removed at high
   speed, and equilibrium was achieved in 80 min. Langmuir (six linear
   forms, i.e., L-I-VI) and other isotherm models were explored for their
   applicability. With the maximum adsorption capacity of 508.7267 mg g(-1)
   and a pH of 4 at 313 K, the adsorption isotherm could be adequately
   characterised using the Langmuir (L-V) model. The kinetics of the
   adsorption process were investigated by fitting experimental data to
   pseudo-second order (PSO) (type-I-VI) and other kinetic models, with the
   findings indicating that the adsorption closely matched the PSO-I model.
   For isotherm models, twelve linear error functions were investigated.
   The absorption process was spontaneous, endothermic, and feasible
   according to the thermodynamics study (Delta G degrees = -8.8888 kJ
   mol(-1), Delta H degrees = 3.1940 kJ mol(-1), and Delta S degrees =
   39.8749 J mol(-1) K-1). The phototoxicity studies revealed that the
   untreated dye was highly toxic compared to the treated dye. It was also
   shown that the material could be recycled substantially, with an RO16
   value of 82.8%. The findings also indicated that the PANI/Fe(NO3)(2)
   material was sufficient for RO16 dye adsorption in both model and real
   water samples.

AB The Colored wastewaters produced from textile industries are enriched
   with toxic reactive dyes that cause serious biotic risk and ecological
   disturbances. The present study aims to decolourize an anthraquinone
   reactive blue-19 dye from aqueous solution by Bacillus cohnii LAP217.
   The selection of influential process parameters and optimization of
   process condition is performed using two-point factorial analysis and
   response surface method, respectively. The results reveal that the
   decolourization of dye is positively influenced by supplementation of
   di-sodium hydrogen phosphate (coefficient estimate: 7.4). The bacterium
   has exhibited 87.3???0.4% decolourization of initial dye concentration
   50?mg/L during the model validation through confirmatory experiment
   analysis, which has satisfactory correlation with model predicted
   response. However, the initial chromate concentration >50?mg/L in the
   medium have negative influence on performance of system by reducing the
   dye decolourization response below <70%, under similar process
   condition. Colored bacterial mass is obtained after the centrifugation
   of treated dye solution and a significant change in the UV-visible
   absorption peak is observed between raw and treated dye solution, which
   confirms the bio-accumulation of reactive blue-19 dye. The bacteria
   could exhibit significant American dyes manufactures institutes (ADMI)
   value reduction percentage of 79.84% during treatment of real

AB Among the multiple uses of tannins. the production of coagulant agents
   is considered one of the most interesting one. The synthesis of
   tannin-derived coagulants is studied through a factorial design in order
   to evaluate the possible combinations between two types of tannin
   extracts (Acacia mearnsii de Wild and Schinopsis balansae) under three
   commercially-available products (Clarotan, Weibull Black and Quebracho
   colorado) and three types of amine compounds (ammonium chloride,
   glycidyltrimethylammonium chloride and diethanolamine). After several
   reproducibility verifications, the optimum product was found to be the
   one from Clarotan and diethanolamine, which was very effective if tested
   with surface river water, dye or surfactant-polluted wastewater. Real
   surface water was clarified with low coagulant dosages (ca. 10 mg L-1),
   while dye concentration was reduced from 100 to 8 mg L-1 and surfactant
   concentration decreased from 50 to 7.5 mg L-1 with coagulant dosage of
   ca. 150 mg L-1. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Wastewater is always composed of different pollutants, most of which are
   toxic to the living being. It is very tough to separate all those
   diverse groups of contaminants using a single process or single
   material. Rather a sustainable and environment friendly processes should
   be adapted to restrict the secondary pollution generation. Nanoclay and
   its nanocomposites are one of the most used adsorbents that have been
   modified and used for the separation of almost all types of pollutants,
   including dyes, heavy metals, fluoride, nitrate, ammonia, emerging
   pollutants and bacteria. They are relatively inexpensive, easy to
   exploit and relatively maintenance-free. Thus, recent research bloomed
   for developing suitable adsorbents, including clay nanocomposites. The
   advantages and drawbacks of all the clay nanocomposites-based processes
   have been discussed critically in this article. Nano-clays or other
   nanoparticles incorporated synthetic and natural polymers-based clay
   nanocomposites were synthesized, and it was found that they can remove
   dyes in the range between 48mg/g and 1994mg/g. Similarly, they separate
   a diverse group of heavy metal ions, including As, Cu, Co, Pd, Zn, Cr,
   Ni, Cd, and Hg, in the range of 0.073-1667mg/g. The clay nanocomposites
   also showed fluoride removal efficacy in the range of 0.134-23mg/g. They
   are also useful for the separation of emerging pollutants like
   pesticides, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, trace elements, and
   particulate matters in the range of 0.1-651mg/g the clay nanocomposites
   showed considerable nitrate, ammonia and bacteria removal efficacy too.
   Though it seems promising, more investigations with real wastewater and
   pilot-scale studies are recommended to explore large-scale wastewater
   treatment capabilities.

AB Chemical activation of Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam (jackfruit peel) via
   phosphoric acid was focused on this study for the preparation of
   activated carbon. Carbonization was done at a temperature of 400 & DEG;C
   based on the nature of biomass after the impregnation ratio of 1 : 1
   (weight of phosphoric acid/weight of raw material). Titanium dioxide was
   doped on the prepared activated carbon through the sol-gel method.
   Titanium dioxide doped activated carbon was synthesized to perceive the
   nature of adsorbents under ambient conditions. Both JPAC and JPAC/TiO2
   adsorbents were characterized by the point of zero charges, Fourier
   transform of infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction spectroscopy,
   Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis, and scanning electron microscopy with
   energy-dispersive X-ray analysis. The adsorption capacity of Reactive
   Red 194 (Red 2BN) dye on jackfruit peel activated carbon (JPAC) is
   32.271 mg/g, and JPAC/TiO2 is 34.900 mg/g was observed under optimum
   conditions. Desorption efficiency of JPAC/TiO2 (>= 93.4%) is slightly
   higher compared to JPAC (>= 89.2%). Tannery effluents of various
   parameters were analyzed, and their chemical oxygen demand (COD) values
   trim down within the permissible limits of JPAC (97%) and JPAC/TiO2
   (98%). Experimental data were studied using both two-parameter and
   three-parameter models of adsorption isotherm, namely, the Langmuir,
   Freundlich, Temkin, Dubinin-Radushkevich, Redlich-Peterson, Sips, Toth,
   and Khan. In which the Langmuir isotherm (R2=0.9824) best described the
   experimental data with an optimum monolayer capacity for adsorption
   capacity of 49.7 mg/g at 323 K on Red 2BN molecules. A proposed scheme
   of Red 2BN molecules on the active sites of adsorbents was illustrated.
   Regeneration of spent carbons was studied through different cycles of

AB The production of dye intermediates made from naphthalene compounds such
   as 6-nitro-1-diazo-2-naphthol-4-sulfonic acid (6-nitro-1,2,4-Acid)
   caused a major environmental concern, mainly due to their nature of
   being highly toxic concentrated organics. In this work, an enhanced
   Fenton process integrating the multi-staged Fenton reaction with inner
   circulation was practiced in a pilot scale. This creative design
   exhibited a particular advantage in treating the wastewater with high
   amount of organic substances. Experiments showed a higher COD removal
   efficiency (93%) and oxidation efficiency (62%) when two-staged Fenton
   reaction with inner circulation (flow-to-influent ratio of 5) was
   applied, whereas only 40.9% of COD reduction was obtained when using the
   single-staged Fenton without any circulation. It was demonstrated
   experimentally that the wastewater color went through a fast change via
   different stages of the reaction. The main intermediates generated along
   the two-staged reaction have been identified as aromatic and aliphatic
   acids, but their concentrations demonstrated regular changes in each
   stage, indicating an enhanced oxidation effect of staged Fenton process.

AB A hybrid anaerobic-aerobic treatability of real textile wastewater was
   investigated by using a lab-scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB)
   coupled with a sequencing batch reactor (SBR). The performance of the
   integrated system was determined under various operational conditions.
   In phase I of the study, the UASB reactor was operated and optimized on
   real textile wastewater. The UASB was operated at a hydraulic retention
   time of 48 h in a semi-continuous mode with 12-h feeding and 12-h
   non-feeding cycle. Volatile fatty acid to alkalinity ratio was kept in
   the range of 0.42-0.72, while pH was strictly maintained between 6.8 and
   7.2 under mesophilic conditions (35 degrees C). In phase II of the
   study, SBR was coupled with a UASB reactor and operated on real textile
   wastewater. The SBR was operated at an HRT of 6 h and solids retention
   time of 20 days. The integrated system was optimized with maximum
   removal efficiencies of 98% for chemical oxygen demand, 94% for color,
   93% for total Kjeldahl nitrogen, and 89% for orthophosphate phosphorus.
   The results indicated that the integrated system is robust and flexible
   for the treatment of textile wastewater.

AB The main objective of this work is to assess the efficiency of
   Amoxicillin (AMX) removal by adsorption on activated carbon (AC). To
   improve the uptake properties, AC was prepared from Jujube nuts (NJs)
   and chemically activated by H2SO4. The morphology and physic-chemical
   properties of the synthesized samples were investigated by XRD and
   SEM-EDS analyses. The main operational parameters like the contact time,
   catalyst dose, initial concentration, pH and temperature were optimized
   step-by-step. The final AMX concentration was analyzed by UV-Vis
   spectrophotometry. The results showed the efficacy of AC with excellent
   adsorption properties. The AMX adsorption equilibrium was reached after
   20 min of contact time and the Langmuir model gives the most accurate
   fit of experimental data. To investigate the uptake mechanism, the
   adsorption constants were determined from the pseudo first order, pseudo
   second-order and intraparticle diffusion models. It was found that the
   kinetic of AMX removal is well described by the pseudo second order
   model. The thermodynamic parameters namely the enthalpy (Delta H degrees
   = - 2.099 J K-1 mol(-1)), entropy (Delta S degrees = 0.112 J K-1
   mol(-1)) and free energy (Delta G degrees = - 16.083 to - 17.208 kJ K-1
   mol(-1)) with rising temperature in the range (25-35 degrees C) indicate
   an exothermic and spontaneous adsorption. The present study shows that
   the AC constitutes an efficient process for the removal of AMX from
   aqueous solution. Finally, the application of this method was extended
   to real effluents.

AB There is no data about the corn silk usage as adsorbent for lead
   removal. In the present study, the corn silk (CS), without any
   modification, was investigated for adsorption of Pb2+ ions from aqueous
   solutions. The CS before and after Pb2+ adsorption was characterized by
   SEM-EDX and ATR-FTIR. The effect of pH, contact time, CS dosage and
   initial metal concentration on process of adsorption was investigated
   using batch adsorption procedure. The experimental data were fitted to
   Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models, and the best data fit was
   achieved with the Freundlich isotherm model. Also the Langmuir and
   Freundlich isotherm models constants R-L and n suggesting favorable
   adsorption of Pb2+ on the CS. Not only the ion -exchange mechanism was
   confirmed as an adsorption mechanism but the complexation process has
   also been verified according to results from ATR-FTIR spectra.
   Thermodynamic parameters were investigated too. Based on desorption
   study result, the adsorbent can be efficiently recovered. The present
   investigation qualified the corn silk (Zea mays L.) as a possible good
   adsorbent of lead from aqueous solutions. (C) 2015 Taiwan Institute of

AB Bisphenol A (BPA) in the aquatic environment have adverse effects on
   human health and other living organisms. BPA at low traces can lead to
   cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, and impaired hepatic enzymes.
   For efficient BPA removal, chitosan immobilized nanoscale zero-valent
   iron (nZVI-chitosan) nanoparticles were synthesized and used as
   adsorbent. Since the BPA removal efficiency depends on independent
   process variables like nZVI-chitosan dosage, initial BPA concentration,
   pH and contact time, experiments were conducted systematically. To
   characterize the interaction effect of these variables, the experimental
   matrix is designed using response surface methodology (RSM). The
   isothermal and kinetic model parameters are estimated using differential
   evolution optimization (DEO), and these parameters better represent
   adsorption behaviour. The batch adsorption experiments indicated that
   the BPA adsorption on to nZVI-chitosan follows pseudo 1st order kinetic
   models. The maximum extent of BPA adsorption was 65.16 mg/g based on the
   Langmuir isotherm model. DEO based model parameters better fit the
   non-linear models with high R-2 and lower RMSE. The regenerability
   experiments indicate that synthesized nZVI-chitosan adsorbent can be
   used up to three cycles with removal efficiency over 50%. The
   thermodynamic studies indicated that Delta G degrees is negative
   signifying a favourable and spontaneous adsorption process. The
   inhibition effects of coexisting ions on BPA adsorption followed the
   order of Mn2+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > Fe2+ for cations and of SO42- > NO3- > Cl-
   for anions. The BPA removal from real pharmaceutical waste water is
   93.8% obtained for optimal initial BPA concentration of 6 mg/L, an
   adsorbent dosage of 1.5 g/L, with solution pH of 3 and adsorption time
   of 1 h, whereas this removal efficiency is 95% for synthetic wastewater.

AB This work investigated the impregnation of Nb2O5 into carbon black (CB)
   in different ratios and its effect in photocatalytic degradation of real
   wastewater from a dyeing factory by advanced oxidative processes (AOP).
   Synthesized catalysts were characterized regarding their crystalline
   structure (DRX, micro-Raman), morphology (MEV), textural (BET area) and
   optical properties (bandgap energy by diffuse reflectance) and pH at the
   point of zero charge (pH(pzc)). Preliminary tests showed better
   photodegradation results in the acidic medium after 5 h of irradiation
   with NCB-0.5 (Nb2O5:CB 0.5:1). Treatment parameters optimization was
   carried out using response surface methodology based on Box-Behnken
   experimental design. Catalyst concentration, solution pH and irradiation
   time were varied, analysing absorbance reduction (285 and 574 nm), COD
   and TOC removal after treatment as responses. The composite catalyst
   showed improved photocatalytic activity, attributed to an increase in
   adsorption capacity and the bandgap narrowing, redshifting the
   absorption edge wavelength to the visible region, brought by CB
   impregnation. Optimal conditions were found at 0.250 g L-1 of catalyst,
   pH 2.0 and 5 h of irradiation, removing 72.19% and 93.52% of absorbance
   in 285 and 574 nm, respectively, 51.29% of COD and 70.70% of TOC using

AB A novel poly(ethyleneimine)/Au nanoparticles/hemin nanocomposite
   (PEI-AuNPs-Hemin) acting for Methyl Orange (MO) removal has been
   synthesized. PEI-AuNPs was prepared firstly and it was then linked to
   hemin through the coupling between carboxyl groups in hemin and amino
   groups in PEI without the activation of carboxyl groups. The high
   reactivity and stability of AuNPs contributed greatly in the formation
   of the amido bonds in the nanocomposite. Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and UV-visible
   spectroscopy were used to characterize the PEI-AuNPs-Hemin. Results show
   that PEI-AuNPs-Hemin has strong adsorption for MO. Adsorption and
   degradation experiments were carried out at different pHs, nanocomposite
   concentrations and UV irradiation times. Removal of MO in acidic
   solutions was more effective than in basic solutions. The real-time
   study showed that the MO degradation with the nanocomposite under UV
   irradiation was a fast process. In addition, the photocatalytic
   degradation mechanism was proposed. The study suggests that the

   A rotavirus. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficiency
   of rotavirus removal in two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in
   Isfahan, Iran. To meet the study objectives, 96 sewage samples from
   influent (n = 48) and final effluents (n = 48) were collected by grab
   sampling. Two different concentration methods included pellet and
   two-phase used for concentrating sewage samples. The presence of
   rotavirus antigens in all concentrated sewage samples was screened by
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent method. To analyze the study samples,
   real-time PCR technique with SYBR Green I fluorescent dye and nested
   multiplex PCR for rotavirus genotyping were utilized respectively.
   Result indicated positive rotavirus percentage in two methods of ELISA
   and real-time PCR was equal to 61.45% (59 cases) and 44.79% (43 cases).
   In addition, analyzing seasonal distribution of rotavirus shows
   different distributions as below: in spring (18.64%), summer (20.33%),
   autumn (35.60%), and winter (25.42%). Finally, rotaviruses illustrate
   significantly higher frequency in cold seasons. G10 and G1 types are
   considered the most, among common genotypes which identified in 11
   (25.58%) and 5 (11.62%), out of the 43 positive samples in WWTPs,
   followed by non-typeable genotypes (13.95%) and mix genotypes (11.62%);
   and different genotypes including G2, G3, G4, G8, G9, and G12 were equal
   to 2.33, 9.30, 9.30, 2.33, 7, and 7% in the WWTPs, respectively. Such
   high prevalence underlines the significance of environmental
   surveillance. Also, to eliminate potential pathogens especially enteric
   viruses from sewage, the improvement of treatment systems is essential.

AB The treatment of an industrial effluent contaminated with a high
   concentration of Ni(II) and Cu(II) was executed using naturally
   available biomasses. Low-cost adsorbents such as wheat bran (WB),
   calcium bentonite (CB), orange peel (OP), and fly ash (FA) were
   synthesized by different protocols and performed further modifications
   to remove Ni(II) and Cu(II). The highest removal efficiency for both
   metals was achieved by modified fly ash with zeolite (FA-Z).
   Physio-chemical characterization studies were performed using field
   emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Fourier transform
   infrared (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and
   Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET). The Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) results
   have indicated the adsorbent had dominant mesopores with a BET surface
   area of 346.62 m(2)/g. The effect of various operating factors on the
   metal removal by FA-Z was investigated and optimized using the central
   composite design (CCD) matrix of response surface methodology (RSM). The
   highest removal efficiency of Cu(II) and Ni(II) was 99.04% and 97.73%,
   respectively, at optimal conditions in the batch study. The highest
   removal efficiency for Cu(II) and Ni(II) was noticed at a bed height of
   5 cm, initial concentration of 100 mg/L, and flow rate of 5 mL/min,
   which is equal to 99% and 96%, respectively in the column study. The
   Langmuir adsorption isotherm holds the best for Ni(II) with a maximum
   adsorption capacity of 60.69 mg/g, indicating monolayer adsorption is
   favorable, whereas, for Cu(II), Freundlich was found to be the best fit
   with a maximum adsorption capacity of 96.42 mg/g, shows the adsorbent
   surface is heterogeneous, and uptake of adsorbate as multi-layered. The
   kinetic study represented the pseudo-second-order (PSO) model was the
   best fit for both Cu(II) and Ni(II) sorption, suggesting a process to
   show chemisorption. The efficiency of modified fly ash with zeolite in
   removing Ni(II) and Cu(II) in multi-metal and real effluent was similar
   to 60% and similar to 95%, respectively. The FA-Z desorption was
   obtained up to 4 cycles, and the desorption efficiency of Cu(II) and
   Ni(II) metal ions achieved 95% and 93%, respectively.

AB The main drawback of Fenton ' s process is the formation of ferric
   sludge. In this work, ion exchange (IE) appears as a complement to the
   Fenton process, allowing, on the one hand, to remove the iron excess
   present in the sludge, as well as reduce the COD of the real olive oil
   industry extraction wastewater (OOIEW) from the Fenton process. The
   Fenton process uses iron (II) sulfate as catalyst, therefore
   concentrations of iron up to 2 g L-1 could be present in the treated
   OOIEW. The iron and COD adsorption equilibrium behavior has been
   modelized by Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin isotherms. Moreover, the
   resin efficiency was tested in a continuous fixed-bed column. It was
   concluded that the resin maintains iron adsorption capacity over at
   least three reuse cycles. Overall Fenton's process followed by ion
   exchange seems to be a promising approach for the treatment of
   cumbersome industrial wastewaters.

AB In the present study, photocatalysts such as copper oxide (CuO) and
   titanium dioxide (TiO2) were coupled with graphene oxide (GO) for the
   synthesis of visible light active CuO-GO/TiO2 composite photocatalyst
   for the decomposition of 2-chlorophenol (2-CP) and complex aromatics in
   the real dairy wastewater. Photocatalytically decomposed dairy
   wastewater was further purified by aerobic digestion. The results
   revealed that composite material shows improved 2-CP degradation, as 86%
   removal was achieved with k=0.0101min(-1) at pH 5.0. The effect of
   pollutant concentration showed that the decomposition of 2-CP increases
   with the increase in the irradiation time and decreases with the
   increase in the 2-CP concentration in the solution. The reusability test
   showed the high stability of CuO-GO/TiO2 composite where the 2-CP
   degradation was achieved 85.8% after the third run. For real dairy
   wastewater degradation, photocatalysis increases the solubilization of
   the organic matters and a 24% higher sCOD (from 5764 to 7536mg/L after
   6h) was observed compared to photolysis (without catalyst) pretreatment.
   This improves the aerobic digestibility of dairy wastewater where tCOD
   was significantly lowered from 12747 to 134.8mg/L within 27days of the
   process. Overall, the present study revealed that the CuO-GO/TiO2
   composite material could be an efficient catalyst for removal of toxic
   organic pollutants and treatment of dairy effluent, thus it can be
   applied in wastewater treatment plants with a dependency of extensively

AB Heterogeneous photocatalysis/persulfate oxidation process has been
   considered as a promising technology for dye contaminants removal. The
   magnetic ZnFe2O4/active carbon (AC) composites were hydrothermally
   synthesized and firstly used to activate peroxydisulfate (PDS) for
   rhodamine B (RhB) degradation under visible LED light irradiation. The
   optimized Vis-ZnFe2O4/AC(4/1)-PDS system can enhance the RhB degradation
   efficiency by 32.01% and 13.87% compared with Vis-ZnFe2O4-PDS and
   Vis-AC-PDS systems, respectively. The influence of operational
   parameters such as catalyst dosage (0.2 - 0.4 g L-1), PDS concentration
   (1.0 - 2.0 g L-1), temperature (25 - 45 degrees C), solution pH (2.7 -
   10.9), and coexisting inorganic ions (Cl-, NO3-, HCO3-, PO43-, Cu2+,
   Fe3+, and Ca2+) on RhB degradation was studied, and 100% of RhB (20 mg
   L-1) was degraded after 80 min at operational condition: 0.30 g L-1 of
   ZnFe2O4/AC(4/1) and 1.5 g L-1 of PDS, solution pH of 2.74, reaction
   temperature of 25 degrees C. The quenching experiments, EPR test, and
   XPS analysis were employed to reveal the proposed mechanism, which
   demonstrated that O-1(2) played a more important role than other
   reactive species (SO4 center dot-, center dot OH, O-2(center dot-), and
   h(+)) in RhB degradation. The generation of O-1(2) via the two routes
   was as follows: (i) the in situ formed active oxygen (O*) reacted with
   HSO5- to produce O-1(2); (ii) O-2(center dot-) was oxidized by h(+) to
   form O-1(2). After five consecutive cycles, the photodegradation
   efficiency of RhB by ZnFe2O4/AC(4/1) catalyst slightly decreased from
   88.52 to 83.92%, indicating the excellent reusability of ZnFe2O4/AC(4/1)
   photocatalyst. As designed, Vis-ZnFe2O4/AC-PDS oxidation system can
   effectively remove RhB from the different real water matrices, and the
   degradation efficiency of RhB in tap water, river water, and secondary
   effluent was 78.24%, 79.55%, and 74.53% after 80 min of reaction,
   respectively.

AB Efficient removal of heavy metals complexed with organic ligands from
   water is still an important but challenging task now. Herein, a novel
   combined process, i.e., Fe(III)-displacement/UV degradation/alkaline
   precipitation (abbreviated as Fe(III)/UV/OH) was developed to remove
   copper organic complexes from synthetic solution and real electroplating
   effluent, and other processes including alkaline precipitation,
   Fe(III)/OH, UV/OH were employed for comparison. By using the
   Fe(III)/UV/OH process, some typical Cu(II) complexes, such as Cu(II)
   ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), Cu(II) nitrilotriacetic acid
   (NTA), Cu(II) citrate, Cu(II) tartrate, and Cu(II) sorbate, each at 19.2
   mg Cu/L initially, were efficiently removed from synthetic solution with
   the residual Cu below 1 mg/L. Simultaneously, 30-48% of total organic
   carbon was eliminated with exception of Cu(II) sorbate. Comparatively,
   the efficiency of other processes was much lower than the Fe(III)/UV/OH
   process. With Cu(II) citrate as the model complex, the optimal
   conditions for the combined process were obtained as: initial pH for
   Fe(III) displacement, 1.8-5.4; molar ratio of [Fe]/[Cu], 4:1; UV
   irradiation, 10 min; precipitation pH, 6.6 -13. The mechanism
   responsible for the process involved the liberation of Cu(II) ions from
   organic complexes as a result of Fe(III) displacement, decarboxylation
   of Fe(III)-ligand complexes subjected to UV irradiation, and final
   coprecipitation of Cu(II) and Fe(II)/Fe(III) ions. Up to 338.1 mg/L of
   Cu(II) in the electroplating effluent could be efficiently removed by
   the process with the residual Cu(II) below 1 mg/L and the removal
   efficiency of similar to 99.8%, whereas direct precipitation by using
   NaOH could only result in total Cu(II) removal of similar to 8.6%. In
   addition, sunlight could take the place of UV to achieve similar removal
   efficiency with longer irradiation time (90 min). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this study, a novel scaled-up hybrid acidogenic bioreactor (HAB) was
   designed and adopted to evaluate the performance of azo dye (acid red G,
   ARG) containing wastewater treatment. Principally, HAB is an acidogenic
   bioreactor coupled with a biocatalyzed electrolysis module. The effects
   of hydraulic retention time (HRT) and ARG loading rate on the
   performance of HAB were investigated. In addition, the influent was
   switched from synthetic wastewater to domestic wastewater to examine the
   key parameters for the application of HAB. The results showed that the
   introduction of the biocatalyzed electrolysis module could enhance
   anoxic decolorization and COD (chemical oxygen demand) removal. The
   combined process of HAB-CASS presented superior performance compared to
   a control system without biocatalyzed electrolysis (AB-CASS). When the
   influent was switched to domestic wastewater, with an environment having
   more balanced nutrients and diverse organic matters, the ARG, COD and
   nitrogen removal efficiencies of HAB-CASS were further improved,
   reaching 73.3% +/- 2.5%, 86.2% +/- 3.8% and 93.5% +/- 1.6% at HRT of 6
   hr, respectively, which were much higher than those of AB-CASS (61.1%
   +/- 4.7%, 75.4% +/- 5.0% and 82.1% +/- 2.1%, respectively). Moreover,
   larger TCV/TV (total cathode volume/total volume) for HAB led to higher
   current and ARG removal. The ARG removal efficiency and current at
   TCV/TV of 0.15 were 39.2% +/- 3.7% and 28.30 +/- 1.48 mA, respectively.
   They were significantly increased to 62.1% +/- 2.0% and 34.55 +/- 0.83
   mA at TCV/TV of 0.25. These results show that HAB system could be used
   to effectively treat real wastewater. (C) 2015 The Research Center for

AB The presence of organic pollutants in the environment, especially in
   water, is recognized as a continuing threat to environmental stability.
   Therefore, the development of new materials for the removal of organic
   pollutants in water are of fundamental importance. In this paper, a
   heterojunction SrSnO3/g-C3N4 photocatalytic system was synthesized and
   its photocatalytical performance for Rhodamine-B (RhB) degradation has
   been tested. For this purpose, in situ luminescence measurements were
   carried out for the first time here, for monitoring the photodegradation
   process in real time under real reaction conditions performance. The
   degradation profiles of RhB using the SrSnO3/g-C3N4 composite and pure
   g-C3N4 showed that the degradation of the dye occurs through different
   mechanisms including four processes: N-de-ethylation, chromophore
   cleavage, opening-ring and mineralization. The results demonstrate that
   the SrSnO3/g-C3N4 ratio 1:1 (SSO3) and 1:2 (SSO4) provide high
   photocatalytic activity under solar light. Best results were observed
   for composite SSO3, which displayed TOC removal of 97.3 +/- 0.03 % after
   4 h of solar exposure, while SSO4 and pure g-C3N4 obtained a rate of
   72.4 +/- 0.03 % and 44.6 +/- 0.04 %, respectively. Result of in situ
   experiments showed that composite SSO3 was 1.7 times more efficient in
   the RhB degradation than pure g-C3N4. The toxicity of phototreated
   solution was evaluated by Fish Embryo Test (FET) showing the successful
   photodegradation of RhB to non-toxic species.

AB Waste effluents of textiles and leather industries are seriously causing
   numerous health problems. Organic dyes are one of the major contaminants
   of industrial wastewater. Adsorption techniques can be used effectively
   to remove organic dyes and treat water for human consumption. In this
   work, we reported a rational multistep synthesis of mesoporous silica
   nanoparticles (MSNs) with selectively generated active inner/external
   surfaces. The functional groups were incorporated into the silica
   surface using a combination of co-condensation and post-grafting
   procedures. Both amine and sulfonic acid functional groups were used to
   produce a total coffer of MSNs inner/outer surface by amino or sulfonic
   moiety denoted as [N-MSNs]-N and [S-MSNs]-S, respectively. Furthermore,
   bifunctional groups were also synthesised by coffering the MSNs outer
   surface by sulfonic acid functional groups and the inner surface with
   amino functional groups or vice-versa denoted as [N-MSNs]-S and
   [S-MSNs]-N, respectively. The efficiency of the multiple grafting
   strategies was evaluated for the removal of cationic dye (methylene blue
   (MB)) from contaminated water samples using batch method mode. The
   physical adsorption parameters such as pH, initial concentrations of MB,
   exposure time and the effect of salt concentration was examined.
   Moreover, the adsorption kinetic models: pseudo first order, pseudo
   second order and interparticle diffusion were also applied for the
   collected data. The highest adsorption performance was accomplished by
   [N-MSNs]-S sorbent with 98% extraction efficiency, whereas the lowest
   adsorption efficiency was observed for [N-MSNs]-N sorbent. Increasing
   the electrolyte concentration had led to an increase in the adsorption
   efficiency of all nanomaterials containing sulfonic acid. An excellent
   extraction efficiency was obtained when the materials were applied to
   spiked real water samples. These adsorbents are promising for the
   removal of MB from wastewater on account of their high adsorption
   capacity and for their resistance to the presence of other unavoidable
   anions in the wastewater. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

AB This work examines the mill scale (MS) of hot rolling, a waste product
   formed in industrial steel processing. MS was evaluated as an iron
   source in promoting the oxidation of Reactive Red 120 azo dye in
   location-sourced and factory textile wastewater through a Fenton
   reaction (FR), as well as reducing hexavalent chromium species to its
   trivalent form in the presence of an organic ligand (citric acid). The
   MS was characterised by various techniques and the results showed that
   iron is the major compound in its composition and occurs mainly in the
   form of oxides (wustite, hematite and magnetite). In addition, it has
   ferromagnetic properties, which facilitate its separation. In the
   oxidation tests it was observed that acidic pH conditions promoted a
   positive influence on the reaction efficiency and that the presence of
   H2O2 can limit the leaching of iron into the solution. The best
   experimental conditions for colour removal from a RR 120 dye solution
   containing 35 mg L-1 were 15 g L-1 of MS, 0.5 mM H2O2, pH 3, 25 degrees
   C, 200 +/- 2 rpm and 120 min. Furthermore, the homogeneous Fenton
   reaction showed a significant contribution to decolourisation, but the
   heterogeneous phase cannot be neglected since it is predominant at the
   beginning of the reactions. In the continuous process, the influence of
   the H2O2 concentration and the feed rate was evaluated, obtaining an
   optimal dose of 0.5 mM H2O2 for the RR dye 120 and 0.7 mM H2O2 for the
   real textile effluent, with a flow rate of 0.25 mL min(-1) and pH 3 for
   both. Subsequently, the residue was evaluated as the source of iron in
   the process of reducing Cr(VI) to Cr(III). An increase in the efficiency
   of the reaction in the presence of citric acid was observed, associated
   with the removal of the surface oxide layer through the formation of
   soluble Fe(III)-Cr(III)-ligand complexes and the consequent increase of
   the iron redox cycle, reducing it to sequencing the reduction of
   chromium. 100% reduction was obtained in 30 min of reaction using 20 g
   L-1 of MS, at pH 3 and Cr(VI):citric acid ratio of 1:4. In continuous
   operation mode, 100% Cr(VI) reduction was obtained during 50 h (1.0 mL
   min(-1) flow rate), dropping to 20% with increasing flow rate to 4.0 mL
   min-1 after 200 h of assay. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study verifies textile wastewater reuse treated by the conventional
   activated sludge process and subjected to further treatment by advanced
   oxidation processes. Three alternative processes are discussed: Fenton,
   photo-Fenton,and UV/H2O2. Evaluation of treatments effects was based on
   factorial experiment design in which the response variables were the
   maximum removal of COD and the minimum concentration of residual H2O2 in
   treated wastewater. Results indicated Fenton's reagent,
   COD/[H2O2]/[Fe2+] mass ratio of 1: 2: 2, as the best alternative. The
   selected technique was applied to real wastewater collected from a
   conventional treatment plant of a textile mill. The quality of the
   wastewater before and after the additional treatment was monitored in
   terms of 16 physicochemical parameters defined as suitable for the
   characterization of waters subjected to industrial textile use. The
   degradation of the wastewater was also evaluated by determining the
   distribution of its molecular weight along with the organic matter
   fractionation by ultrafiltration, measured in terms of COD. Finally, a
   sample of the wastewater after additional treatment was tested for reuse
   at pilot scale in order to evaluate the impact on the quality of dyed
   fabrics. Results show partial compliance of treated wastewater with the
   physicochemical quality guidelines for reuse. Removal and conversion of
   high and medium molecular weight substances into low molecular weight
   substances was observed, as well as the degradation of most of the
   organic matter originally present in the wastewater. Reuse tests
   indicated positive results, confirming the applicability of wastewater
   reuse after the suggested additional treatment.

AB Reverse osmosis (RO) have been widely used to produce clean water and
   there is a strong need to enhance their permeability at no sacrifice of
   their other performances, e.g., selectivity. We deposit low-cost
   biopolymer, lignin, onto the surface of RO membranes by a simple
   filtration method. Lignin is deposited to the membrane surface via both
   hydrogen bonding and - interaction. Lignin deposition reduces the
   surface roughness of the membrane and enhances its negatively charging,
   while the surface hydrophilicity is maintained. Surprisingly, water
   permeation, salt rejection, and fouling resistance of the
   lignin-deposited membranes are simultaneously improved. More
   importantly, we demonstrate that this deposition method can be easily
   extended to modify commercial RO membrane modules, indicating the
   excellent upscalability of this method. We use the lignin-deposited
   membranes to treat real effluents of dyeing and papermaking and they
   perform much better than the virgin, unmodified membranes. (c) 2017

AB Leachates are still an open issue in environmental protection. Many of
   the applied methods for their treatment present low efficiency and thus
   need to be used collectively. In practice reverse osmosis is mostly
   used, as it is the most effective option, regardless of its cost.
   Magnetic methods to treat effluents have been used for water and
   wastewater treatment by the use of magnetic particles together with
   magnetic separation for the removal of contaminants. However,
   large-scale applications are few or even non-existent when we deal with
   complex contaminated media such as landfill leachates, for which not
   even research studies at laboratorial scale with real samples have been
   done yet. In this work, we apply for the first time magnetic sorption
   for the treatment of leachates, and close the full cycle by studying the
   regeneration and re-use of the magnetic particles; we also study the
   influence of the concentration of magnetic particles, the use of several
   pre-treatment methodologies and the type of particle used in the
   process, in real landfill samples from the waste treatment plant of
   Salamanca (Spain), for the removal of COD, NO3-, NO2-, NH4+, Total-N,
   PO43-, SO42- and Cl-. Regeneration of the magnetic particles alter being
   used in the sorption stage is also studied, as well as their efficiency
   regarding their re-use. It is also determined the optimum number of
   batches for complete desorption and for regeneration of the particles,
   the effect of successive regeneration and re-use cycles, the use of two
   different regeneration methods, the efficiency of the desorption, the
   effect of the quantity of solvent and the influence of the time of
   sorption. Due to its innovative character and the complexity of the
   media, this work represents a first preliminary approach and, although
   some promising results have been obtained, further studies are required
   to completely understand and evaluate the proposed treatment process.

AB A hybrid anaerobic reactor with built-in bioelectrochemical system (BES)
   has been verified for efficiently treating mixed azo dye wastewater, yet
   still facing many challenges, such as uncertain reactor construction and
   insufficient electron donors. In this study, an up-flow hybrid anaerobic
   reactor with built-in BES was developed for acid orange 7 (AO7)
   containing wastewater treatment. Cathode and real domestic wastewater
   both served as electron donor for driving azo dye decolorization. The
   decolorization efficiency (DE) of A07 (200 mg/L) in the hybrid reactor
   was 80.34 +/- 2.11% with volume ratio between anaerobic sludge and
   cathode (VRslu:cat) of 0.5:1 and hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 6 h,
   which was 15.79% higher than that in BES without sludge zone. DE was
   improved to 86.02 +/- 1.49% with VRsiu:cat increased to 1:1. Further
   increase in the VRslu:cat to 1.5:1 and 2:1, chemical oxygen demand (COD)
   removal efficiency was continuously improved to 28.78 +/- 1.96 and 32.19
   +/- 0.62%, but there was no obvious DE elevation (slightly increased to
   87.62 +/- 2.50 and 90.13 +/- 3.10%). BES presented efficient electron
   utilization, the electron usage ratios (EURs) in which fluctuated
   between 11.02 and 13.06 mol e-/ mol A07. It was less than half of that
   in sludge zone of 24.73-32.06 mol e-/mol A07. The present work optimized
   the volume ratio between anaerobic sludge and cathode that would be
   meaningful for the practical application of this hybrid system. (C) 2016

AB The practicability and application of the batch electrochemical
   coagulation (ECC) for the treatment of real textile wastewater (TWW) was
   evaluated using stainless steel (SS) electrodes in sequence. The central
   composite design using response surface methodology was used to evaluate
   and optimize the effect of current density, electrolysis time and
   electrode numbers as independent variables on the color and chemical
   oxygen demand (COD) removal as the response function. The significance
   of the independent variables and their interactions was tested by means
   of analysis of variance (ANOVA) with 95% confidence level showing R-2
   value of 91.48% for color and 92.08% for COD. An optimal current density
   180 A/m(2), 45 min of electrolysis time and 4 SS electrodes in ECC
   showed minimal deviations of the observed values giving the predicted
   value of 93.60% color and 90.21% COD removal efficiency ensuring a
   satisfactory adjustment of the second-order regression model with the
   experimental data. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive
   X-ray (EDX) and thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) characterized the
   sludge generated after ECC treatment. SEM images showed vicissitudes on
   the anode plate with large dents and flake deposits. EDX results of post
   ECC sludge showed high amounts of metals because of electrode
   dissolution. TGA plots showed the completion of the oxidation process at
   higher temperature and the residue remained in it. The operating cost
   was found to be 2.97 Rs./m(3) (Indian Rupee) and the specific energy
   consumption was 8.1 kWh/m(3) of TWW treated for color and COD removal
   using 4 SS electrodes.

AB Water with phosphate concentrations above 2 mu M may adversely affect
   aquatic life and human health. In this study, the parameters affecting
   phosphate removal from aqueous solutions by ion exchange were
   investigated - contact time and temperature, initial pH, initial
   phosphate concentration and resin dosage, and the presence of other
   ions. The best phosphate removal (99%) from 100 mg-P/L initial solution
   was observed at pH 10 and 25 degrees C after 3 hours of contact time. No
   negative phosphate removal results were obtained from phosphate
   solutions containing sulfate, nitrate and ammonium ions, i.e.,
   resembling real wastewater. Desorption (with NaOH or NaCl) and recovery
   (with CaO) studies of phosphate sorbed by resin were also carried out,
   as well as thermodynamic investigations. The proportional desorbability
   of phosphate from the resin with NaCl was 85.6%. The recovery efficiency
   of phosphate was 79.4%. The sorption process was spontaneous and
   endothermic. The ion exchange mechanism was determined using different
   internal and external diffusion models. The mechanism controlling the
   removal of phosphate from aqueous solution is both internal and external
   diffusion. Application of the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models
   showed that the experimental results fit well with the Freundlich model.

AB Graphene oxide has great potential for use as an adsorbent due to the
   high specific surface area, high negative charges, and abundant
   oxygen-containing functional groups. However, the difficulty of graphene
   oxide to separate from water renders it impractical for real water
   treatment. In the present study, a novel graphene
   oxide/hexadecyltrimethylammonium composite sponge (GO/HDTMA) was
   prepared and investigated for use as a filtration material for the
   removal of Cu(II) from water. The formed porous GO/HDTMA sponge was
   highly stable in water. The adsorption was spontaneous and exothermic,
   increasing with decreasing temperatures. The material showed good
   ability to remove Cu(II) with competing cations (K+, Na+, Ca2+, and
   Mg2+) present. Five cycles of adsorption-desorption-regeneration studies
   showed that, after adsorption, the material could be successfully
   regenerated for repeated use by using a 1-M HCl solution as the
   desorption reagent. At a sufficiently high dose, GO/HDTMA showed an
   excellent performance for Cu(II) removal from river water containing
   different coexisting solutes. Finally, our 30-day column study revealed
   that the GO/HDTMA sponge is a good filtering material for the removal of
   Cu(II) from river water. In conclusion, the GO/HDTMA sponge is an
   excellent adsorbent material for use in flow-through water treatment
   applications for Cu(II) removal.

   treatment of a real textile effluent using a pilot plant with compound
   parabolic collectors (CPCs), was investigated. The influence of the main
   photo-Fenton reaction variables such as iron concentration (20-100 mg
   Fe2+ L-1), pH (2.4-4.5), temperature (10-50 degrees C), and irradiance
   (22-68 W-UV m(-2)) was evaluated in a lab-scale prototype using
   artificial solar radiation. The real textile wastewater presented a
   beige color, with a maximum absorbance peak at 641 nm, alkaline pH
   (8.1), moderate organic content (dissolved organic carbon (DOC)=129 mg C
   L-1 and chemical oxygen demand (COD) = 496 mg O-2 L-1), and high
   conductivity mainly associated to the high concentration of chloride
   (1.1 g Cl- L-1), sulfate (0.4 g SO42 -L-1), and sodium (1.2 g Na+L-1)
   ions. Although all the processes tested contributed to complete
   decolorization and effective mineralization, the most efficient process
   was the solar photo-Fenton with an optimum catalyst concentration of 60
   mg Fe2+ L-1, leading to 70% mineralization (DOCfinal = 41 mg C L-1;
   CODfinal < 150 mg O-2 L-1) at pH 3.6, requiring a UV energy dose of 3.5
   kJ(UV)L(-1) (t(30 W) = 22.4 min; <(T)over bar> = 30 degrees C (U) over

   irradiation time, laser energy, and initial MB concentration on the
   decolorization rate were investigated. Experiments using real samples of
   textile dyeing wastewater were also carried out to examine the
   effectiveness of the method in more complex samples. From the results,
   the following conclusions may be drawn: (i) Under the optimum conditions
   (pH 7.19, 135 mJ laser energy, 4mg/L MB concentration, and 11.6mg/L GNP
   concentration), the rate of MB decolorization could reach 94% in 15min.
   The decolorization follows pseudo-first-order kinetics; (ii) The amount
   of MB decreased rapidly during the decolorization. No intermediates of
   the decolorization could be detected by high-performance liquid
   chromatography. These observations indicate that MB was decolorized
   through a very rapid degradation mechanism; (iii) The rate of MB
   decolorization increased with the increase in laser energy (at laser
   energies of 0 to 135 mJ); and, (iv) The efficient decolorization of MB
   in real samples of textile dyeing wastewater was achieved at a

AB The current research reports an efficient methodology of new sorbent
   (SSBC) synthesis based on neglected sepia shells for the sequestration
   of cationic dye (Methylene blue, MB) and an anionic dye (Reactive black
   5, RB5) from aqueous solutions. The as-synthesized SSBC was produced by
   reaction of sepia shell powder with urea in the presence of
   formaldehyde. In the first part of the work, the sorbent was scrutinized
   by using scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis,
   Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, and titration (for determining
   pH(PZC)). In the second step, the influence of several parameters
   including pH effect, sorbent dosage, temperature, and ionic strength on
   the two dyes' sorption effectiveness was examined. The sorption
   isotherms and uptake kinetics were analyzed at the optimum pH. Outlined
   results showed that the dynamic experimental obtained data followed the
   Langmuir isotherm profile, while the kinetic profile fitted well to the
   pseudo-second-order rate equation. Maximum sorption capacities reach up
   to 0.794 mmol g(-1) (254.05 mg g(-1)) for MB and 0.271 mmol g(-1)
   (269.18 mg g(-1)) for RB5, at pH 10.5 and 2.3, respectively. By
   comparing the sorption properties at different temperatures, the
   endothermic nature of the sorption process was revealed. Sorption
   processing under microwave irradiation (microwave-enforced sorption,
   MES) enhanced mass transfer, and a contact time as low as 1 min is
   sufficient under optimized conditions (exposure time and power) reaching
   equilibrium, while 2-3 h was necessary for a "simple" sorption. Dye
   desorption was successfully tested using 0.5 M solutions of NaOH and HCl
   for the removal of RB5 and MB, respectively. The as-prepared sorbent can
   be reused for a minimum of 4 cycles of sorption/desorption. Finally, the
   sorbent was successfully tested on spiked tap water and real industrial
   wastewater.

AB Azolla pinnata (AP), a floating aquatic macrophyte, was studied as a
   potential adsorbent for the removal of methyl violet (MV) in a batch
   adsorption system. Surface characterisation, effects of particle size,
   adsorbent dosage, pH, ionic strength and pre-treatments of adsorbent
   were carried out. The study of the effects of pH and ionic strength
   suggested that electronic interaction and hydrophobic-hydrophobic
   interaction might be the major forces of dye interaction. Pseudo 2nd
   order kinetic model best-fitted the kinetic data indicating that the
   adsorption process may be controlled by chemical process. The
   Weber-Morris and Boyd models were used for describing the diffusion
   mechanism which showed that intraparticle diffusion was not the rate
   limiting step, and film diffusion or in combination of other mechanisms
   might be in control. Isotherm modelling showed that the Langmuir model
   best-fitted the experimental data with q (m) of 194.2 mg g(-1) at 25 A
   degrees C and 323.4 mg g(-1) at 65 A degrees C. Thermodynamic studies
   showed that the adsorption process is endothermic, spontaneous and with
   significant change to the internal structure of adsorbent. The estimated
   activation energy by Arrhenius equation is 54.8 kJ mol(-1), which
   indicates that the adsorption process may be controlled by chemical
   process. Adsorbent regenerated using NaOH displayed retention of high
   adsorption capability almost similar to fresh adsorbent even after five
   consecutive cycles. Ability to regenerate coupled with good adsorption
   capability suggests that AP has great potential to be utilised as a
   low-cost adsorbent for the removal of MV in real life application.

AB In this study, the biosorption perfor- mance of Thamnidium elegans (T.
   elegans) immobilized on Phragmites australis (P. australis), a new
   biocomposite (TEPA), was examined for decolorization of water using
   batch and column mode tests. Various affecting experimental parameters
   such as pH, biocomposite amount, and stirring speed were examined and
   optimized by an experimental design. Regression analysis indicated that
   the findings of the Box-Behnken experimental design (BBD) optimization
   experiment closely match a quadratic model. ANOVA findings revealed that
   pH and TEPA amount affected Reactive Blue 49 (RB49) biosorption yield.
   Optimum experimental RB49 decolorization was achieved with the
   biosorption yield of 96.51% at the conditions of pH: 1.68, TEPA mass:
   53.4 mg, stirring speed: 204 rpm, and contact time: 45 min. RB49
   sorption onto TEPA was explained using the Elovich and the
   pseudo-second-order kinetic and the Freundlich isotherm models. The
   maximum RB49 sorption capacity was 140.36 mg g(-1) at defined optimum
   conditions. Unloaded and dye-loaded biocomposite sorbents were
   characterized by SEM and FTIR analysis. The isoelectric point of TEPA
   was found as pH 1.7 by the zeta potential measurements. Furthermore, the
   newly developed biocomposite sorbent indicated the promise in terms of
   decolorizing real wastewater without losing dye sorption ability.
   Saturation biosorption capacities in column mode were 104.58 and 70.98
   mg g(-1) in dye solution and real wastewater samples, respectively. TEPA
   can be considered cost-effective, ecofriendly, and promising alternative
   adsorbent for decolorization of reactive dye contaminated wastewater, as
   shown by all the findings.

AB Nano-activated carbon (NAC) prepared from El-Maghara mine coal were
   modified with nitric acid solution. Their physico-chemical properties
   were investigated in terms of methylene blue (MB) adsorption, FTIR, and
   metal adsorption. Upon oxidation of the AC(S) with nitric acid, surface
   oxide groups were observed in the FTIR spectra by absorption peaks at
   1750-1250 cm(-1). The optimum processes parameters include HNO3/AC ratio
   (wt./wt.) of 20, oxidation time of 2 h, and the concentration of HNO3 of
   10% reaching the maximum adsorption capacity of MB dye. Also, the
   prepared NAC was characterized by SEM, EDX, TEM, Raman Spectroscopy, and
   BET analyses. The batch adsorption of MB dye from solution was used for
   monitoring the behavior of the most proper produced NAC. Equilibrium
   isotherms of MB dye adsorption on NAC materials were acquired and the
   results discussed in relation to their surface chemistry. Langmuir model
   recorded the best interpretation of the dye adsorption data. Also, NAC
   was evaluated for simultaneous adsorption of six different metal ions
   (Fe2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Pb2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+) that represented contaminates
   in petrochemical industrial wastewater. The results indicated that the
   extracted NAC from El-Maghara mine coal is considered as an efficient
   low-cost adsorbent material for remediation in both basic dyes and metal
   ions from the polluted solutions.

AB Ion-exchange polymer and modified carbonization bacterial cellulose
   (CBC) electrodes were fabricated using varying amounts of
   cation-exchange polymers (glutaric acid (GA) and sulfosuccinic acid
   (SSA)) and assembled within an asymmetric capacitive deionization unit
   (p-CDI). The performance of selective NO2- electro-adsorption was
   studied. The AC/CBCSSA group showed a better salt adsorption capacity
   (14.56 mg/g) and nitrite removal efficiency (71.01%) than the AC/CBC-GA
   (10.72 mg/g, 47.83%) and AC/AC (4.81 mg/g, 12.74%) groups. It was
   confirmed that the CBC-SSA/GA electrodes enhanced nitrite selectivity
   and increased the adsorption capacity, and the total amounts of adsorbed
   anions increased when the applied voltage was increased from 0.8 to 1.2
   V, while the molar fraction of nitrate decreased. The competitive and
   preferential adsorption of anions was further investigated using
   different binary solutions of anions and occurred in the following
   sequence: NO2- > SO2- 4 > NO3- > F- approximate to Cl-. Furthermore, the
   p-CDI units were applied to remove nitrite in real wastewater samples,
   and the results showed that they had excellent reusability and
   application for use in dyeing wastewater treatment. (C) 2020 The

AB Metronidazole (MET), a recalcitrant antibiotic from the nitro-imidazole
   family and commercially used Rhodamine B (RhB) dye, contributes a huge
   to water pollution, which needs to eliminate, preferably by
   photocatalytic degradation technique. The Cdots@zeolite (CDZ)
   nanocomposites with different weight ratios (1:1, 1:3, 1:5, 5:1, 1:7)
   were synthesized hydrothermally to degrade MET and RhB molecules. The
   CDZ composites were characterized by XRD, BET, EDS, and XPS technique
   which verifies the crystalline nature, incorporation of C-dots into
   zeolite frameworks with high surface area (similar to 187 m(2)/g). The
   morphology, d-spacing and lattice planes were analyzed by SEM images,
   HR-TEM and SAED analysis. The maximum degradation (similar to 79%) was
   achieved at an optimum catalyst dose of 0.2 g/L and pH 4 for MET and
   that of RhB was similar to 90% at a catalyst dose of 0.4 g/L. The PZC
   (point of zero charge) value for CDZ composite was about pH 3.4, which
   justifies the maximum removal of MET at pH 4. The obtained rate
   constants 'k' were found to be 0.0081, 0.0041, and 0.0101 min(-1) in
   sun, UV, and visible light sources, respectively. The real industrial
   wastewater sample has been treated to give similar to 68% of COD and
   similar to 62% TOC removal. Moreover, the intermediates of plausible
   degradation pathways were identified by the m/z values obtained from
   GC-MS analysis.

AB Nanoscopic modifications leading to multi-dimensional graphene
   structures are known to significantly influence their candidature for
   several applications including catalysis, energy storage, molecular
   sensing and most significantly adsorption and remediation of harmful
   materials such as dyes. The present work attempts to identify the key
   trajectories that connect the structural qualification with a chosen
   application, viz., the interactive forces in dye remediation. Various
   physico-chemically Modified Graphene Nanostructures (MGNs) such as 2
   dimensional Graphite, Graphene Oxide (GO), reduced GO (rGO), holey rGO,
   and 3 dimensional GO hydrogel and Holey GO hydrogel are chosen and
   synthesised herein. These represent varieties of physicochemical
   features with respect to their dimensionality, surface features such as
   oxygen functionality, nanoscopic holes etc., that contribute to their
   characteristic overall surface interactions. Methylene Blue (MB), a
   popular industrial effluent posing major environmental concern is chosen
   to be a probe adsorbate in this case study. An exclusive real time
   in-situ UV visible spectral experiment provides the revealing reasons
   behind the outstanding performance of 2D GO sheets with an adsorption
   capacity of greater than 92 % even at high MB concentrations (>2000
   ppm). A complex dependency of various factors such as surface oxygen,
   morphology, nanoporosity etc. on the unique overall interaction with an
   adsorbent such as MB by all these adsorbates is demonstrated using
   experimental and DFT based computational studies. Electrostatics and
   hydrogen bonding are understood to be the two dominant forces driving
   the MB adsorption on the best performing GO here.

AB In the current study, the mechanistic understanding of the adsorption
   isotherm and thermodynamic aspects of cationic methylene blue (MB) dye
   adsorption onto cellulosic olive stones biomass from wastewater were
   investigated. The batch adsorption of MB onto the olive stones (black
   and green olive stones) was tested at a variety of pH, dye
   concentrations, temperatures, and biomass particle sizes. The adsorption
   thermodynamics such as Gibbs free energy, enthalpy, and entropy changes
   were also calculated. Moreover, the desorption studies of MB from the
   spent olive stones were studied to explore the re-usability of the
   biomasses. The results revealed that under the optimum pH of 10, the
   maximum MB uptake was achieved i.e. 80.2% for the green olive stones and
   70.9% for the black olive stones. The green olive stones were found to
   be more efficient in remediating higher MB concentrations from water
   than the black olive stones. The highest MB removal of the green olive
   stones was achieved at 600 ppm of MB, while the highest MB removal of
   the black olive stones was observed at 50 ppm of MB. Furthermore, for
   almost all the concentrations studied (50-1000 ppm), the MB adsorption
   was the highest at the temperature of 45 degrees C (P value < 0.05). It
   was shown by the Fourier transform infrared that the electrostatic
   interaction and hydrogen bonding were proposed as dominant adsorption
   mechanisms at basic and acidic pH, respectively. While the
   hydrophobic-hydrophobic interaction was a dominant mechanism at neutral
   pH. The thermodynamic studies revealed that the adsorption process was
   endothermic, spontaneous, and favorable. Moreover, the real wastewater
   experiment and the desorption studies showed that the green and black
   olive stones were a cost-effective and promising adsorbents for MB
   remediation from wastewater on account of their high adsorption and
   desorption removal capacities.

AB Diazinon which is one of the most widely used toxins and pesticides, is
   responsible for contaminating surface and ground water sources all over
   the world. This study aims to determine the photo-catalytic degradation
   of diazinon using TiO2/ZnO/CuO nanocomposite under solar radiation in
   aqueous solutions. First, TiO2/ZnO nanoparticles were synthesized, then
   they were doped by 0.5%, 1%, and 2% of copper oxide. To characterize
   nanoparticles, the scanning electron microscope, energy-dispersive X-ray
   spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy, MAP, and zeta potential analysis were conducted; and also
   the effects of different variables such as copper dopant percent, pH,
   nanoparticles dose, initial concentration of diazinon and contact time
   were evaluated on photo-catalytic reaction using one factor at time
   procedure. The results showed that the dopant percent of copper oxide
   was effective for removing diazinon so that doping of 0.5%, 1%, and 2%
   of copper oxide had the efficiency of 53%, 71%, and 61%, respectively,
   and they were more than uncoated nanoparticles (TiO2/ZnO) in the same
   condition. Based on the results, the highest removal rate of diazinon
   after 120 min of reaction time was 91% under optimal conditions (pH = 7,
   1% copper dopant, and 2 g/L nanoparticles). Therefore, it can be
   concluded that the photocatalytic process by TiO2/ZnO/CuO nanoparticles
   could effectively eliminate diazinon under real conditions.

AB The PPy/TiO2 and PPy/P25 composites prepared via the in situ
   polymerization in H2SO4 solution with different concentrations were
   studied for Acid Red G (ARG) or Methylene Blue (MB) adsorption. Their
   physicochemical properties were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD),
   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetric
   analysis (TGA) and zeta potential analysis. The results showed that the
   H2SO4 concentration and the property of metal oxide (self-prepared TiO2
   or commercial P25) obviously affected the nature and adsorption
   abilities of the PPy/TiO2 and PPy/P25 composites. The composites can
   adsorb Acid Red G (ARG) or Methylene Blue (MB) rapidly and reach the
   equilibrium in 30 min. The adsorption amount of ARG on the composites
   decreased with the increase of pH value, while the MB removal efficiency
   increased with pH increase. The adsorption behaviors of ARG and MB on
   the composites were described by the pseudo-second-order and Langmuir
   isotherm models. According to the Langmuir isotherm, the PPy/TiO2
   composites exhibited larger maximum adsorption amount than PPy/P25,
   especially with the PPy/TiO2 composite prepared in 0.16 mol/L H2SO4
   (0.16 M-PPy/TiO2), on which the maximum adsorption amounts of ARG and MB
   were 218.82 and 323.62 mg/g, respectively. Regeneration experiments
   revealed that the 0.16 M-PPy/TiO2 composite can be regenerated easily
   and reused for six times without visible loss of its original capacity.
   Additionally, its adsorption efficiencies of ARC and MB in real
   effluents were still higher than 87% after adsorption-desorption for
   four times. Through comparing the FT-IR spectra of PPy/TiO2 before and
   after adsorption, as well as the surface charge measurement, it can be
   speculated that electrostatic interaction, hydrogen bonding and specific
   chemical interaction may be the possible mechanism for the adsorption of
   ARG and MB by the PPy/TiO2 composites. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB This study aims to investigate the efficiency of a pilot prototype

   nano-bimetallic iron/copper (Fe/Cu) degradation and adsorption units for
   the removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand
   (BOD), color, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and TSS from
   real textile wastewater. The total removal efficiencies of the system
   were 96, 98, 82, 69, 88, and 97%, respectively, using 0.5 g/L ferric
   chlorides as a coagulant under an optimum adsorption condition of pH
   6.0, nano-dosage 1.4 g/L, contact time 80 min, and stirring rate 250
   r/min at room temperature. Adsorption isotherms indicated that the
   removal of COD and TP obeys both Koble-Corrigan and Freundlich
   adsorption models, removal of color obeys both Koble-Corrigan and Hill
   adsorption models, and removal of TN and TSS obeys Koble-Corrigan and
   Khan models, respectively. Avrami kinetic models adequately describe the
   adsorption data for COD, BOD, TN, and TSS, while pseudo-second-order and
   intraparticle models described the removal mechanism of color and TSS,
   respectively. An artificial neural network (ANN) with r(2)-value
   exceeding 0.98 is accurate and can be used with confidence in predicting
   removal efficiencies of the targeted parameters. Sensitivity analysis
   results showed that the initial concentration was the most influential
   parameter for TSS removal with relative importance greater than 25%,
   while the bimetallic Fe/Cu dosage was the most influential factor for
   all other studied parameters with relative importance greater than 40%.
   The total treatment cost of the proposed system per m(3) after scaling
   up was found to be US$4.5 for reuse of the treated water for the
   irrigation of forest trees.

   air bubbles, without problems related to packed bed photoreactors (PBRs)
   to improve photocatalytic degradation of four different classes of dye
   in water in comparison with that of PBR. The real volume of NPFR (V-r)
   including the net volume of dye solution, without the dead volume of air
   bubbles (V-D), was determined to reach the maximum photodegradation
   (X-Max). The suspension increased the uniform distribution and effective
   surface of particles to contact to uv light in comparison with those of
   fixed bed in PBR, that this property improved due to decreasing their
   size in NPFR, too. X-Max. values using alpha-Fe2O3 NPs/pectin were more
   than those of other forms in NPFR with Vr values of 76.5, 70.2, 80.6 and
   81.4 ml for removal of Methylene blue, Bismarck brown Y, Rhodamine B and
   Malachite green at 298 K, respectively using experimental volume of
   reactor of 94.2 ml.
   To have a PBR with the same conditions, Fe2O3 NPs with the mean size
   equal to that of alpha-Fe2O3 NPs/pectin used in NPFR, was used the
   Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method.

AB Hybrid advanced oxidation processes have been gained a great regard for
   the degradation of organic pollutants. This study demonstrated the
   performance of combination of Electro-Peroxone (EP) and ultrasound (US)
   to degrade acid orange 7 (AO7) for the first time. The effect of
   influencing factors was investigated on AO7 degradation including
   solution pH, applied current, ozone dosage and US power. Decolorization,
   total organic carbon (TOC) removal and carboxylic acids evolution were
   considered to evaluate AO7 degradation. Total decolorization and 88 %
   mineralization were obtained at pH = 7.0, 33 mg/L ozone dosage, 300 mA
   applied current and 100 W US power. The presence of chloride ion and
   nitrate ion suppressed the function of EP/US process. The pseudo-first
   order model was well fitted for AO7 degradation by EP/US process. There
   was a synergistic effect between US application and EP process in which
   US could activate both O-3 and electrogenerated H202. The rate constant
   obtained of AO7 degradation for the pseudo-first order model was 0.276
   min(-1) for EP/US process. In comparison with Electro-Fenton (EF)
   process, a higher efficiency was observed for EP process in term of AO7
   degradation and mineralization. Moreover, the synergistic phenomenon was
   considerable in EP/US compared to EF/US process. EP/US was conducted on
   a real wastewater and, it was successful in degradation of organic
   pollutants in real conditions. Finally, EP/US demonstrated a promising
   electrochemical approach for treatment of contaminated water.

AB Natural water resources are polluted due to human activities like
   discharge from municipal and industrial wastewater. In general
   industrial wastewater contains toxic chemicals like heavy metals, dyes,
   acids etc. To save the water bodies it is necessary for industries to
   treat their wastewater before disposal. Agricultural wastes like green
   adsorbents may be considered as an alternative to minimize the problems
   regarding heavy metal pollution particularly for small and medium sized
   industries. In this study walnut shell, an agricultural waste is used
   for Cr(VI) removal as green adsorbent. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET),
   Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Point of zero charge (pH(pzc)) and
   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were used to characterise
   the walnut shell. Column studies were performed for different operating
   conditions and low influent flow rate, low influent Cr(VI) concentration
   and higher bed depth give better adsorption. Langmuir isotherm model
   fitted well for Cr(VI) adsorption equilibrium (K-L = 0.6754 L/mg, R-2 =
   0.9996). Different kinetic models are applied on experimental data to
   evaluate model parameters and their applicability. Yan et al. model
   fitted well for the specified operating range (K-gamma = 5903.63 mL/(mg
   min), R-2 = 0.9785) and applied for scale-up designing. Regeneration
   studies are conducted by using different concentration of NaOH to
   investigate the reusability characteristics of walnut shell. Scale-up
   design for Cr(VI) removal using walnut shell as an adsorbent and its
   economic feasibility are done to find out its applicability in real
   life. This study reveals that walnut shell is an efficient and cost
   effective adsorbent for Cr(VI) removal and it can be a solution for
   Cr(VI) discharging industries. (C) 2018 Institution of Chemical

AB Since from the last couple of decades, the waste and its management has
   became the most prominent problems that the world is facing serious
   issues nowadays. Most of the waste in the environment can be reutilized
   very easily via simple physical/chemical treatments. Under this, we have
   proposed a novel, simple, economical, sustainable, and renewable
   approach for cleaning polluted water by proper utilization of carbon
   from the exhausted water filter cartridges (EWFC). The activated carbon
   (AC) from the environmental EWFC was obtained through simple
   reactivation by a moderate physical treatment in the furnace (400
   degrees C; 1hr). The results from XRD,FE-SEM, BET, RAMAN, and TEM
   characterization bear out the successful generation of AC from EWFC
   (AC-EWFC). In the proposed work methylene blue (MB) dye was used as a
   model pollutant. To estimate the maximum adsorption capacity of AC-EWFC,
   a batch adsorption technique was implemented and it was found to be
   55.62 mg.g(-1). The influence of various core parameters like solution
   pH, amount of AC-EWFC, MB dye concentration, and the interaction period
   was carried out. Furthermore, AC-EWFC was tested for kinds of
   traditional as well as emerging contaminants such as dyes,
   pharmaceuticals, metal ions and it showed interesting results by an
   unconventional method. Moreover, the study was employed for real
   wastewater effluents samples from industries. Most importantly, AC-EWFC
   adsorbent showed good results for the kinds of pollutants, and support
   to carbon reutilization from EWFC is possible with nominal treatment and
   can be used for environmental remediation on a commercial scale. (C)

   L-cysteine modified heterogeneous Fenton-like Fe(III) degradation
   (Cys-Fe(III)@mSiO(2)). The structure and morphology of
   Cys-Fe(III)@mSiO(2) were characterized by scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD),
   infrared spectra (FT-IR) and other characterizations. Fe(III) ions are
   uniformly dispersed on the Cys-Fe(III)@mSiO(2) microgel surface. The
   modification of L-cysteine to Fe(III)@mSiO(2) not only improved the
   silica-based coagulating efficiency but also expanded the degradation pH
   of heterogeneous Fenton-like Fe(III) reaction for nanofiltration
   concentrates. The degradation efficiencies of nanofiltration
   concentrates are also compared with Fe(II) and Fe(III) supported silica
   coagulants. The effective pH range of Cys-Fe(III)@mSiO(2) was expanded
   up to 6.5 and the color and COD degradation efficiencies reached above
   90% and 85 % for simulated nanofiltration concentrates, which were also
   higher than Fe(II) and Fe(III) supported silica coagulants. The
   degradation mechanism was investigated for simulated nanofiltration
   concentrates, which suggested the Cys-Fe(III)@mSiO(2) Fenton/coagulation
   process might comprehensively reduce the color and COD for real
   nanofiltration concentrates effluent.

AB Solid residue from hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of nutrient rich
   feedstock presents a promising source to recover valuable nutrients,
   such as phosphorus, in the solid form. The present work shows for the
   first time the potential of utilizing the waste residue remaining after
   nutrients extraction from HTL of sewage sludge, as renewable adsorbents.
   A parametric study was undertaken to investigate the influence of
   chemical activation conditions (temperature, residence time, activation
   agent loading, washing after activation) on raw and partially
   demineralized HTL solids. Kinetic and equilibrium adsorption
   investigation was undertaken for the removal of methylene blue (MB) from
   aqueous solution. For comparison purposes, a commercial activated
   charcoal (AC) was used. Demineralization was found to have a significant
   influence in the adsorption capacity of the resultant adsorbents. Three
   adsorbents were found to follow the Langmuir adsorption model, while the
   acid washed demineralized adsorbent had higher adsorption capacity than
   AC and was found to follow the Freundlich adsorption model. The superior
   performance of the acid washed demineralized adsorbent was verified from
   the kinetic study where all adsorbents were found to best fit the
   pseudo-second order model. Adsorption capacities for MB at equilibrium
   were 367.1, 332.3, 297.4 and 87.6 mg/g, for acid washed demineralized
   adsorbent, AC, demineralized adsorbent, and raw adsorbent, respectively.
   Finally, the most promising adsorbents were assessed for their
   adsorption capacity to remove pharmaceuticals present in a real
   wastewater treatment effluent. Results indicated ultimate concentration
   for all targeted compounds below the detection limits for acid washed
   demineralized adsorbent, AC and demineralized adsorbent. Future
   implementation of HTL technology in wastewater treatment facilities,
   will not only provide an efficient way to valorize sewage sludge into
   bio-crude and nutrients, but can also enhance technology integration by
   providing the precursors for renewable adsorbents needed in tertiary
   treatment of wastewater.

AB Abstract The deterioration of the environment is a matter of great
   concern today and has led to the development of research to remedy the
   harmful effects caused by man with his industrial activity overflowing.
   Water bodies are being affected by pollutant discharges from industries
   using dyes and pigments, as it is an alteration to aquatic systems by
   the interference in the passage of light and potentially toxic particles
   that have effects not only on the aquatic organisms but also possible
   indirect effects on human health. This research is developed to know and
   choose the most appropriate toxicity measurement techniques to evaluate
   the impact of these effluents loaded with dyes and pigments for their
   subsequent application to real residual water samples. A bibliographic
   review of different techniques for aquatic toxicity evaluation is
   carried out and the importance of the application of these tests in the
   evaluation of the advantages, and the efficiency of the color removal
   treatments is emphasized.

AB A novel magnetic adsorbent based on hydrolyzed Luffa Cylindrica (HLC)
   was synthesized through the chemical co-precipitation technique, and its
   potential was evaluated in the adsorptive elimination of divalent nickel
   ions from water medium. Morphological assessment and properties of the
   adsorbent were performed using FTIR, SEM, EDX, XRD, BET, and TEM
   techniques. The effect of pH, temperature, time and nickel concentration
   on the removal efficiency was studied, and pH = 6, room temperature (25
   C), contact time of 60 min, and Ni2+ ion concentration of 10 mg.L-1 were
   introduced as the optimal values. At optimal conditions, the removal
   efficiency of Ni2+ ions using HLC and HLC/CoFe2O4 magnetic composite was
   calculated as 96.38 and 99.13%, respectively. The adsorption process
   kinetic followed a pseudo-first-order model. Langmuir isotherm was
   suitable for modelling the experimental data of the Ni2+ adsorption. The
   maximum elimination capacity of HLC and HLC/CoFe2O4 samples was
   calculated as 42.75 and 44.42 mg g(-1), respectively. Furthermore,
   thermodynamic investigations proved the spontaneous and exothermic
   nature of the process. The adsorption efficiency was decreased with
   increasing the content of Ca2+ and Na+ cations in aqueous media. During
   reusability of the synthesized adsorbents, it was found that after 8
   cycles, no significant decrease has occurred in the adsorption
   efficiency. In addition, real wastewater treatment results proved that
   HLC/CoFe2O4 magnetic composite has an excellent performance in removal
   of heavy metals pollutant from shipbuilding effluent.

   treatment process. More improvement of the corrosion resistance was
   achieved by adding sodium hexa-meta-phosphate (SHMP) corrosion inhibitor

   synthetic solution using ferrioxalate (CuOFeB) and Al, Fe-bentonite
   (AIFeB) catalysts in the solar-assisted Fenton process was evaluated, as
   well as impact of H2O2 photolysis on the process efficiency.The
   photo-Fenton oxidation of dye has been investigated using a
   concentrating solar parabolic reactor with constant solar radiation of
   550 W/m(2) and 950W/m(2) for spring and summer periods, respectively.
   Experimental data has proved that photolysis of hydrogen peroxide has an
   important role in the process of decolorization, achieving a
   decolorization efficiency over 80.78% at pH 7. Under the optimal
   reaction conditions, both catalysts showed a good stability in the
   processes with dye removal over 90%. The mineralization efficiency
   depends on the intensity of the solar radiation, wherein similar to 50%
   was achieved under the higher solar intensity. Comparing reaction rate
   it is important to note that the larger specific surface area of AIFeB
   (155.83 m(2)/g) makes him a superior catalyst and thus solar-assisted
   Fenton process with this catalyst fast and efficient. Based on the
   decolorization rate constants, the examined processes can be placed in
   the following order: AIFeB (950 W/m(2))> AIFeB (550 W/m(2)) > CuOFeB
   (950 W/m(2))> CuOFeB (550 W/m(2)). These findings are confirmed on real
   effluent, whereby a greater degree of decolorization (91.89%) and
   mineralization (43%) has been achieved with AIFeB catalyst compared to
   CuOFeB (30.09% and 15%) during the process. (C) 2018 Taiwan Institute of

AB Towards the imperative water contamination by organic dyes, uniform
   hierarchical quasi waxberry-like Ba5Si8O21 microspheres (diameter:
   0.65-1.30 mu m) consisted of nanorods have been successfully synthesized
   via a facile ecofriendly and cost-effective rotating hydrothermal
   process (120 degrees C, 6.0 h) without any organic additives, templates
   or surfactants, using abundant BaCl2 center dot 2H(2)O and Na2SiO3
   center dot 9H(2)O as the raw materials. Based on the impacts of the
   process parameters, a probable heat and mass transport enhanced rotating
   hydrothermal formation mechanism is proposed. The rotating homogeneous
   hydrothermal reactor provides vigorous macro- and micro-mixing of the
   solid and solution phase, thus favors the early stage
   dissolution-recrystallization, formation of the product nuclei at lower
   temperature, and final self-assembly for uniform waxberry-like
   microspheres with miniaturization of size. When employed as the
   adsorbents for the elimination of Congo red (CR) from simulated waste
   water, the adsorption data are well fitted with Langmuir isothermal
   model (q(m): 1238.7 mg g(-1)). Meanwhile, the adsorption of CR is well
   described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic and infra-particle
   diffusion models, indicating the final diffusion at equilibrium stage
   within the mesopores of the real rate-limiting step in the whole
   adsorption process. The recycling test further confirms the Ba5Si8O21
   microspheres as highly efficient adsorbents with satisfactory stability
   and reusability. As a noteworthy methodology, the heat and mass
   transport enhanced rotating hydrothermal synthesis presents new insights
   into the hierarchical porous silicate microspheres as a competitive
   candidate adsorbent for organic dyes removal, and also a potential new
   platform for heterogeneous catalysis.

   the present work, a membraneless sleeve-type BES (termed BioE) was
   designed for the treatment of synthetic coal gasification wastewater
   (CGW, phenol as a model pollutant) and real CGW. Compared with the
   biological control (termed Bio), the phenol removal rate and COD removal
   efficiency increased by 2.6 and 2.1 fold in the BioE, respectively.
   However, the coulombic efficiency of this system was relatively low,
   ranging from 0.42% to 2.6%. This combination of results indicated that
   anode respiration was not the main process in the BioE. The increased
   CH4 production and higher levels of methanogens obtained from the BioE
   confirmed that the methanogenic process proceeded, possibly facilitated
   by the diffusion of H-2 from the cathode to the anode. This study
   provides new insight into biocathode function for COD oxidation removal
   in BESs. Moreover, this study indicates that pursuing a high coulombic
   efficiency may not be necessary for wastewater treatment, as it consumes
   less energy at the lower value. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Biochar has been widely studied as an adsorbent for the removal of

   performed to understand the state of research in utilizing biochars for

   co-exist in wastewater from several industrial activities, such as
   textile, pharmaceutical and mining industries. Such pollutants include
   organic (such as synthetic dyes, phenolic compounds) and inorganic
   contaminants (such as cadmium, lead). Multiple correspondence analyses
   suggest that through batch equilibrium, columns or constructed wetlands,
   researchers have used mechanistic modelling of isotherms, kinetics, and
   thermodynamics to evaluate contaminant removal in either synthetic or
   real industrial wastewaters. The removal of organic and inorganic
   contaminants in wastewater by biochar follows several mechanisms:
   precipitation, surface complexation, ion exchange, cation-p interaction,
   and electrostatic attraction. Biochar production and modifications
   promote good adsorption capacity for those pollutants because biochar
   properties stemming from production were linked to specific adsorption
   mechanisms, such as hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. For
   instance, adsorption capacity of malachite green ranged from 30.2 to
   4066.9 mg g(-1) depending on feedstock type, pyrolysis temperature, and
   chemical modifications. Pyrolyzing biomass at above 500 degrees C might
   improve biochar quality to target co-existing pollutants. Treating
   biochars with acids can also improve pollutant removal, except that the
   contribution of precipitation is reduced for potentially toxic elements.
   Studies on artificial intelligence and machine learning are still in
   their infancy in wastewater remediation with biochars. Meanwhile, a
   framework for integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning
   into biochar wastewater remediation systems is proposed. The
   reutilization and disposal of spent biochar and the contaminant release
   from spent biochar are important areas that need to be further studied.

AB The photochemical degradation of two azo and two anthraquinonic dyes was
   performed using potassium peroxymonosulphate (Oxone (R)) activated by UV
   radiation. The fast decolourization of all dyes was observed within 6
   min of UV irradiation, with corresponding dye decays higher than 80%.
   The kinetic rate constants of the dyes' decay were determined, along
   with the energetic efficiency of the photochemical treatment, taking
   into account the influence of a few anions commonly present in real
   wastewaters (i.e., chloride, nitrate, carbonate/bicarbonate and
   phosphate ions). Chloride and carbonate/bicarbonate ions enhanced dye
   degradation, whereas phosphate ions exerted an inhibitory effect, and
   nitrates did not have a predictable influence. The dye decolourization
   was not associated with efficient mineralization, as suggested by the
   lack of a significant total organic carbon (TOC) decrease, as well as by
   the low concentrations of a few detected low molecular weight
   by-products, including nitrate ions, formaldehyde and organic acids.
   High molecular weight by-products were also detected by mass
   spectrometry analysis. The investigated process may be proposed as a
   convenient pre-treatment to help dye degradation in wastewater during
   combined treatment methods.

AB Advanced oxidation processes have been used for wastewater treatment due
   to their capacity to reduce the organic loading and for their fast
   reactions. In this paper, we explore the viability of isolated and
   sequential use of electrochemical oxidation and Fenton processes into
   treatment of real raw urban sewage. The electrochemical process was
   carried out using DSA (R)-Cl-2 electrodes and factorial planning in
   order to investigate the influence of pH, current density, and
   electrolyte. Fenton reaction was also used and H2O2 and Fe2+
   concentration effects were investigated. The efficiency was estimated by
   chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal and in the optimized conditions the
   effluent was characterized by turbidity, suspended/dissolved/total
   solids, ammonia, chloride ions, free chlorine, nitrite, and potassium
   analysis and bioassays with Artemia ssp. and Lactuca sativa. The study
   demonstrated that the use of electrochemical technique followed by
   Fenton allowed an improvement in the degradation of organic matter and
   reduction of turbidity and solid content, reaching reductions of 86.8,
   96.4, 99.4, 56.1, and 66.7% for COD, turbidity, SS, DS, and TS,
   respectively. The associated treatment also contributed to the reduction
   of energy consumption by 74.9%, from the 23.9 kWh m(-3) observed during
   the electrochemical treatment isolated to the 6 kWh m(-3) during the
   associated process. All the treatments presented toxicity reduction,
   with the electrochemical process achieving the best results.

AB The inefficiency of conventional water treatment methods in the
   treatment of recalcitrant herbicides has led to the search for new,
   efficient and eco-friendly mechanisms for degrading these organic
   pollutants. Electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOP) have
   emerged as a promising alternative due to their high degree of
   efficiency in degrading organic pollutants. This work investigates the
   removal of Tebuthiuron (TBH) in synthetic and real wastewater using
   different EAOPs in a flow-by reactor. The degradation/mineralization
   experiments were performed using boron-doped diamond electrode as anode
   and gas-diffusion electrode (GDE) as cathode for the in situ
   electrogeneration of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). For the analysis
   conducted in synthetic medium, TBH degradation was found to fit well in
   a pseudo-first-order kinetic reaction with increasing k1 values
   according to the following order of efficiency: anodic oxidation (AO,
   3.1 x 10-5 s-1) < AO with H2O2 generation (AO-H2O2, 4.8 x 10-5 s-1) <
   electro-Fenton (EF, 5.9 x 10-5 s-1) < AO-H2O2/UVC (2.6 x 10-4 s-1) <
   photoelectro-Fenton (PEF, 3.2 x 10-4 s-1). AO-H2O2/UVC and PEF processes
   presented the highest rates of mineralization and similar energy
   consumption per order (45 kWh m-3 order-1). The degradation experiment
   conducted using real urban wastewater yielded a 1.7-fold decrease in TBH
   degradation kinetics compared to the synthetic medium; this difference
   was attributed to the presence of inorganic ions and natural organic
   matter in real wastewater which tended to affect the electrochemical
   system efficiency. The findings of this study are of great interest and
   confirm the viability of electrochemical techniques for treating complex
   effluents contaminated by herbicides.

AB Biobarriers, as permeable reactive barriers (PRBs), are a common
   technology that mainly uses bacteria to remediate groundwater in
   polluted aquifers. In this study, we propose to use Trametes versicolor,
   a white-rot fungus, as the reactive element because of its capacity to
   degrade a wide variety of highly recalcitrant and xenobiotic compounds.
   A laboratory-scale artificial aquifer was constructed to simulate
   groundwater flow under real conditions in shallow aquifers. Orange G dye
   was chosen as a contaminant to visually monitor the hydrodynamic
   behaviour of the system and any degradation of the dye by the fungus.
   Batch experiments at different pH values (6 and 7) and several
   temperatures (15 degrees C, 18 degrees C, 20 degrees C and 25 degrees C)
   were performed to select the appropriate residence time and glucose
   consumption rate required for continuous treatment. The maximum Orange G
   degradation was 97%. Continuous degradation over 85% was achieved for
   more than 8 days. Experimental results indicate for the first time that
   this fungus can potentially be used as a permeable reactive barrier in
   real aquifers. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This research investigated the ozonation of Basic Green 4 (BG4) under
   the presence of acetic acid (AA). This acid is used as a textile
   additive for many industrial dyes derived from triphenylmethane.
   Determining the effect of this additive on discoloration, degradation
   dynamics, and final by-product distribution is the main objective of
   this study. The reaction system was the ozonation of a dye solution in
   co-solvents. This solution (dye and AA) was considered a simplified
   version of real BG4 dyeing wastewaters supplied with additives. The dye
   concentration was set to 50, 150, and 250mg/L without pH adjustment (pH
   = 3). This low value was forced by the AA. Ozonation reaction with dye
   was mainly done by a direct molecular mechanism. The discoloration
   dynamics of BG4 without and with the additive were determined by
   ultraviolet and visible wavelength spectroscopy. The dye decomposition
   and the intermediate and final product formation-decomposition dynamics
   were followed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The effects of
   AA in the ozonation results were significant in the following ways: 1) a
   possible complex, formed between AA and the dye, changed ozone
   consumption; 2) the presence of additive decelerated the dye
   discoloration and decomposition; and 3) the number of by-products was
   dissimilar in both systems, with and without the additive the ozonation.
   The accumulation of organic acids with low molecular weight was
   determined in both systems, with and without the additive. Only one
   by-product was obtained in ozonation when AA participated in the
   reactor. A possible reaction mechanism is proposed for the system
   dye-AA-ozone.

AB Various methods for the degradation and detoxification of textile
   effluents have been developed in recent years and among these, advanced
   oxidation processes (AOPs) have been proven to be a successful way of
   degrading organically contaminated water into a useful form. The
   synchrotron X-ray (3-20 keV) irradiation-assisted AOP has been developed
   for the degradation of single and mixed colored industrial wastewater
   solution. Irradiation experiments were conducted on industrial effluents
   obtained straight from the cloth industries. The efficiency of AOP was
   measured by characterizing irradiated industrial wastewater solutions
   with optical, chemical, and biological characterization techniques. The
   UV-Vis spectroscopy and chemical oxidation demand (COD) results revealed
   that the wastewater was degraded and the degradation efficiency could be
   tailored by varying the X-ray dose. The complete decolorization and ~
   85% removal in COD was obtained at the X-ray dose of 15000 mAs. Chemical
   species present in pristine and irradiated wastewater were analyzed
   using FTIR techniques. The FTIR spectra revealed the destruction of the
   aromatic ring and nitrogen linkage of wastewater under X-ray
   irradiation. The technique of liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy
   (LC-MS) was employed to identify and quantify the unknown compounds
   present in pristine as well as X-ray irradiated wastewater solutions.
   Toxicity assays on gram-negative Escherichia coli (DH5 alpha) clearly
   show detoxification of X-ray irradiated solutions. This study
   demonstrates a fast and effective approach for completely degrading and
   detoxifying industrial wastewater, and has a wide range of applications
   in environmental remediation.

AB Real textile wastewaters were treated by a combined method with fungi
   and activated sludge. In this work, the white rot fungus Trametes
   pubescens MUT 2400 which has already showed to decolorize wastewaters,
   was exploited for biodegradation purposes with the aim to scale-up the
   system to larger working volumes. A bubble column reactor, a fixed bed
   reactor and a stirrer tank reactor were investigated. Colour, COD and
   toxicity were monitored before and after both the treatments. It was
   thus possible to identify the main targets towards which the two
   biological methods are mainly effective: colour for fungi whereas COD
   and toxicity for the activated sludge. Both the growth and the
   degradation yiedl of the fungus were highly affected by the different
   aeration and agitation conditions, with strong repercussion on the final
   process yields. Actually, DP values were very low when the bubble column
   reactor was used. On the contrary, the stirrer tank reactor resulted the
   best reactoristic configuration: the extensive decolourisation (85 %)
   and the COD reduction (95 %) were coupled with a significant
   detoxification monitored by L. sativum test. Consequentially, thanks to
   the combined biological treatment, the textile effluent parameters
   complied the Italian legal threshold limit for the discharge in surface
   waters.

AB Chitosan is an abundant natural biopolymer which finds a variety of
   applications due to its functionalization extending to pharmacology,
   controlled drug delivery, healing materials, biomedical engineering,
   food industry, agriculture, catalysis, biosorbents, wastewater
   treatment, etc. Chitosan can be transformed to distinct derivatives and
   composites and be modified and grafted for specific use. Many products
   like flakes, fine powders, beads, membranes, sponges, fibers, and gels
   can be formed from chitosan. Degradable membranes made of chitosan in
   conjunction with other materials have increased their scope and include
   adsorptive membranes for heavy metal and dyes, biomedical applications
   of chitosan electrospun nanofibers, metal complexation, polymer and
   modified chitosan-based nanocomposites, cellulose and chitosan
   composites in wastewater treatment, fuel cells and catalysis. The review
   has focused on a number of issues related to the said areas. Application
   of these composite membranes with real industrial effluents should be
   done with reference to the commercial adsorbents and then their
   application for removal of aromatics, oils, surfactants, etc. will

AB Hazardous dyes are unleashed in water systems from different industries
   that these materials have trouble with health and environmental balance.
   Therefore, this research expands a selective sensor for determining
   residual hazardous textile dyes in wastewaters. A novel electrochemical
   sensor based on RuO2/reduced graphene oxide/carboxylated multiwalled
   carbon nanotubes (RuO2/rGO/CMWCNTs) modified glassy carbon electrode was
   developed for simultaneous determination of acid blue 40 (AB 40) and
   acid blue 29 (AB 29). The morphology and structure of the
   RuO2/rGO/CMWCNTs were investigated by field emission scanning electron
   microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray
   spectroscopy (EDS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR).
   The properties of several parameters affecting the sensitivity of the
   determination of both species, such as scan rate, accumulation time,
   accumulation potential and pH were investigated. The electrochemical
   behavior of these species was investigated using square wave voltammetry
   (SWV) under the optimized condition. Linear dynamic ranges for AB 40 and
   AB 29 determination were 0.05-50.0 mu mol L-1 and 0.5-75.0 mu mol L-1
   with the detection limits of 0.01 and 0.1 mu mol L-1, respectively.
   Finally, the applicability of the electrochemical sensor was verified by
   the real wastewater samples analysis.

AB The utilization of renewable and functional group enriched nano-lignin
   as bio-additve in fabricating composite has become the focus of
   attention worldwide. Herein, lignin nanoparticles in the form of hollow
   spheres with the diameter of the order of 138 +/- 39 nm were directly
   prepared from agro-industrial waste (palm kernel shell) using recyclable
   tetrahydrofuran in an acidified aqueous system without any chemical
   modification steps. We then fabricated a new chitosan/nano-lignin
   composite material as highly efficient sorbent, as demonstrated by
   efficient removal (similar to 83%) of methylene blue (MB) dye under
   natural pH conditions. The adsorption process obeyed pseudo-second-order
   kinetics and adequate fitting of the adsorption data using Langmuir
   model suggested a monolayer adsorption with a maximum adsorption
   capacity of 74.07 mg g(-1). Moreover, thermodynamic study of the system
   revealed spontaneous and endothermic nature of the sorption process.
   Further studies revealed that chitosan composite with nano-lignin showed
   better performance in dye decontamination compared to native chitosan
   and chitosan/bulk lignin composite. This could essentially be attributed
   to synergistic effects of size particularity (nano-effect) and
   incorporated functionalities due to lignin nanoparticles. Recyclability
   study performed in four repeated adsorption/regeneration cycles revealed
   recyclable nature of as-prepared composite, whilst adsorption
   experiments using spiked real water samples indicated recoveries as high
   as 89%. Based on this study, as-prepared bio-nanocomposite may thus be
   considered as an efficient and reusable adsorptive platform for the
   decontamination of water supplies. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB In this study the interactions between toxicity removals and Kemicetine,
   COD removals, intermediate products of Kemicetine and COD components
   (CODs originating from slowly degradable organics, readily degradable
   organics, inert microbial products and from the inert compounds) were
   investigated in a sequential anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR)/aerobic
   completely stirred tank reactor (CSTR) system with a real pharmaceutical
   wastewater. The total COD and Kemicetine removal efficiencies were 98%
   and 100%, respectively, in the sequential ABR/CSTR systems. 2-Amino-1
   (p-nitrophenil)-1,3 propanediol, 1-p-amino phenyl, p-amino phenol and
   phenol were detected in the ABR as the main readily degradable
   inter-metabolites. In the anaerobic ABR reactor, the Kemicetin was
   converted to corresponding inter-metabolites and a substantial part of
   the COD was removed. In the aerobic CSTR reactor the intermetabolites
   produced in the anaerobic reactor were completely removed and the COD
   remaining from the anerobic reactor was biodegraded. It was found that
   the COD originating from the readily degradable organics did not limit
   the anaerobic degradation process, while the CODs originating from the
   slowly degradable organics and from the inert microbial products
   significantly decreased the anaerobic ABR reactor performance. The acute
   toxicity test results indicated that the toxicity decreased from the
   influent to the effluent of the aerobic CSTR reactor. The ANOVA test
   statistics showed that there was a strong linear correlation between
   acute toxicity, CODs originating from the slowly degradable organics and
   inert microbial products. A weak correlation between acute toxicity and
   CODs originating from the inert compounds was detected. (C) 2009

AB Printing and packaging process wastewater (PPPW) with high flow rates
   causes severe damage to the environment due to high organic pollution
   (3830.0 mg O-2/L of COD and 813.6 mg/L of TOC) and turbidity (9110 NTU).
   This study examined the efficiencies of coagulation, Fenton, and
   photo-Fenton procedures, and their combinations in the treatment of
   PPPW. The three inorganic salts (FeCl3, Al-2(SO4)(3), and Fe-2(SO4)(3))
   were used in a wide range of pH (2.5-10) as a coagulant, and FeCl3 was
   chosen as the optimum coagulant. The 71.3% of TOC removal and the
   decreasing of turbidity up to 5.8 NTU were obtained at 0.5 g/L FeCl3 and
   pH of 6.0. Then, Fenton and photo-Fenton processes were applied to the
   effluent of the coagulation process. The Fenton process engaged the TOC
   removal efficiencies up to 85.2% in the presence of 7.350 g/L iron
   catalysts and 36.0 mL/L H2O2. The combined coagulation and Fenton
   process is a promising way to decrease the COD up to 119 mg O-2/L,
   meeting the wastewater discharge standards of COD (200 mg O-2/L) in
   Turkey. However, adding UV sources to the Fenton process showed a little
   bit of engagement (only %1.4 extra removal). When evaluated for PPPW, it
   is seen that the usage of combined coagulation and the Fenton process is
   an important treatment alternative. Furthermore, Zeta potential
   measurements and size exclusion chromatography were used to understand
   the removal mechanism.

AB Since the human consumption of coal is increasingly growing and
   coal-based solid wastes are discharged in large quantities, the resource
   utilization of coal-based solid wastes has been paid more attention. In
   the present work, for the first time, the coal gasification fine slag is
   subjected to prepare ZSM-5 zeolites with ultra-low n(SiO2)/n (Al2O3)
   ratios (less than 20) and hierarchical pore structures. The increase in
   the concentration of the alkaline extract leads to the decrease of the
   crystallinity, the irregularity of the microscopic morphology, and the
   decrease of the specific surface area, resulting in the in-situ
   generation of mesopores within ZSM-5. Moreover, adsorption experiments
   demonstrate that ZSM-5-2M exhibits the best methylene blue adsorption
   performance at the pH of 9 with a removal rate of up to 82.07%, and it
   also has good adsorption performance in simulated real water samples.
   Furthermore, the adsorption performance of ZSM-5-2M on the malachite
   green, Rhodamine B, Congo red, and methyl orange has been investigated
   and it is found to be very effective for the adsorption of cationic
   dyes, and its adsorption performance for methylene blue and malachite
   green is reduced in the presence of anions.

AB In wastewater treatment, flocculation is a widely used solid/liquid
   separation technique, which typically employs a charged polymer, a
   polyelectrolyte (PEL). Polyelectrolytes features, such as charge type,
   charge density and molecular weight, are essential parameters affecting
   the mechanism of flocculation and subsequent floc sedimentation. The
   effectiveness of the process is also influenced by the characteristics
   of the system (e.g., type, size, and available surface area of suspended
   particles, pH of the medium, charge of suspended particles). Thus, a
   good understanding of the flocculation kinetics, involved mechanisms and
   flocs structure is essential in identifying the most adequate treatment
   conditions, having also into consideration possible subsequent
   treatments. In this study, Eucalyptus bleached pulp and a cellulosic
   pulp with high lignin content (similar to 4.5 wt%) obtained from
   Eucalyptus wood waste were used for bio-PELs production. Firstly, a
   pre-treatment with sodium periodate increased the pulps reactivity. To
   produce cationic cellulose the oxidation step was followed by the
   introduction of cationic groups in the cellulose chains, through
   reaction with Girard's reagent T. Applying different molar ratios (0.975
   and 3.9) of Girard's reagent T to aldehyde groups led to cationic PELs
   with diverse charge density. On the other hand, to obtain anionic
   cellulose a sulfonation reaction with sodium metabisulfite was applied
   to the intermediate dialdehyde cellulose-based products, during 24 or 72
   h, and anionic-PELs with diverse features were obtained. The developed
   water soluble, anionic and cationic bio-PELs were characterized and
   tested as flocculation agents for a textile industry effluent treatment.
   Initially, jar-tests were used to tune the most effective flocculation
   procedure (pH, flocculant dosage, etc.). Flocculation using these
   conditions was then monitored continuously, over time, using laser
   diffraction spectroscopy (LDS). Due to the small size of the dyes
   molecules, a dual system with an inorganic complexation agent
   (bentonite) was essential for effective decolouration of the effluent.
   Performance in the treatment was monitored first by turbidity removal
   evaluation (75-88% with cationic-PELs, 75-81% with anionic-PELs) and COD
   reduction evaluation (79-81% with cationic-PELs, 63-77% with
   anionic-PELs) in the jar tests. Additionally, the evolution of flocs
   characteristics (structure and size) during their growth and the
   flocculation kinetics, were studied using the LDS technique, applying
   the different PELs produced and for a range of PEL concentration. The
   results obtained through this monitoring procedure allowed to discuss
   the possible flocculation mechanisms involved in the process. The
   results obtained with the bio-PELs were compared with those obtained
   using synthetic PELs, commonly applied in effluents treatment,
   polyacrylamides. The developed bio-PELs can be competitive, eco-friendly
   flocculation agents for effluents treatment from several industries,
   when compared to traditional synthetic flocculants with a significant
   environmental footprint. Moreover, LDS proved to be a feasible technique
   to monitor flocculation processes, even when a real industrial effluent
   is being tested.

   (RR141) as toxic dye model, characterization methods such as X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR),
   scanning electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive X-ray
   analysis(SEM-EDAX)and have been employed to identify the adsorbent.
   Surface area and pore size volume were determined by the Brunauer,
   Emmett and Teller (BET) method. Environmental factors such as pH, time
   of contact, initial RR141 concentration, the dose of adsorbent and
   solution temperature have been all put to the test to evaluate optimum
   adsorption activity. Thermal processing NP/NiO at 1% NiO doping
   percentage was effectual for exhibiting best adsorption behavior at an
   annealing temperature of 600 degrees C. Furthermore, batch experiments
   revealed significant adsorption activity reaching 96%. The maximal
   adsorption capacity was found to be 38.91 mg of RR 141 per 0.1 g of the
   adsorbent in only 40min of contact, at an initial colorant concentration
   of 20 mg L-1, pH 6 at ambient temperature and a volume of 100 ml.
   Langmuir isotherm model was more adequate to describe the adsorption
   process than the Freundlich model. The rate mechanism of the adsorption
   process was determined from the intraparticle diffusion model, Boyd plot
   revealed that the adsorption of the dye on the NP/NiO was mainly
   governed by film diffusion. Moreover, the dye adsorption was spontaneous
   and exothermic. The mechanism of adsorption may involve chemical
   adsorption through hydrogen bonding mechanism and electrostatic
   interactions between the dye molecules and the adsorbent. Thermal
   regeneration was feasible only for three cycles, the adsorbent also
   showed great potential for real textile wastewater treatment.

AB The treatment of winery wastewater is necessary since it constitutes an
   environmental problem due to its high organic content and chemical
   oxygen demand and its low pH. However, these characteristics hinder the
   use of conventional technologies commonly utilized for the treatment of
   effluents. Therefore, new technologies for the management of this type
   of wastewater are required. In this sense, the photo electro Fenton
   process (PEF) was proposed as a good alternative because of the
   synergetic effect among Fenton, electrolysis and photolysis processes.
   In this study, the development of a new double chamber cubic reactor for
   the treatment of winery wastewater using PEF was performed. Surface
   response methodology was applied based on Box-Behnken design to define
   the best operational conditions. The selected key variables were
   voltage, distance between electrodes and the organic load of the
   effluent. Among the parameters optimized, distance between electrodes
   and voltage were identified as significant in the model. Under the
   optimized conditions the treatment of real winery wastewater was
   efficiently carried out. Finally, it can be concluded that the
   configuration of this reactor is suitable for the remediation of this
   type of effluents. (C) 2015 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published

   catalysts (x = 0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05) and their utilization for the
   photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine B dye. Structurally, the band
   gap energy of the catalysts tended to decrease (1.94-1.70 eV) with
   increasing the amount of La3+ dopant. ZnLa0.05Fe1.95O4 had an average
   particle size (40 nm), high surface area (41.07 m2 g-1) and large pore
   volume (0.186 cm3 g-1). Moreover, the effect of doping ratio, reaction
   time, H2O2 concentration, catalyst loading on the treatment performance
   of La3+ substituted ZnFe2O4 nanocomposites was investigated.
   ZnLa0.05Fe1.95O4/H2O2 system exhibited the highest degradation
   efficiency of 99.5% and nonlinear pseudo first-order kinetic reaction
   rate (14.8 x 10-3 min- 1) in the presence of visible light irradiation.
   The key role of reactive oxygen species involving center dot O2- and
   center dot OH radicals was well explained through the scavenger study. A
   plausible mechanism of the degradation of Rhodamine B dye was also
   proposed. Due to two advantageous points including high recyclability
   (up to 4 cycles) and stability, La3+ substituted ZnFe2O4 nanocomposites
   can be an effective and competitive catalyst for the visible
   light-driven photodegradation of toxic dyes in the real wastewaters.

   nanoparticles and investigate the catalytic activity of C-MgO in
   catalytic ozonation process (COP) for treating a real textile
   wastewater. A fractional factorial design was conducted to assess the
   interactions between operating parameters (pH, ozone flow rate, catalyst
   dose, reaction time) for the catalytic treatment of the textile
   wastewater via the C-MgO catalyst. The experiments of degradation and
   mineralization results matched well with those attained by the predicted
   models. Fractionate of the contribution reactive oxygen species (ROSs)
   and O-3 in COD removal indicated that ROSs had a dominant role in the
   mineralization of the recalcitrant compound in examining the textile
   wastewater sample. C-MgO showed better potential catalytic activities
   (synergetic effect = 57%) as compared with plain nano MgO and O-3 alone
   in COD elimination. The catalytic activity findings demonstrated that
   the mineralization rate of the COP with the C-MgO catalyst was 5.7 times
   that of the plain nano MgO/O-3 process. Based on the results, this
   report showed that the C-MgO catalyst could be applied in COP for
   treating real textile wastewaters.

   performances and microbiological investigations for the optimum
   treatment of textile industry wastewater performed with sequencing batch

   SBR treatment unit, optimum treatment efficiency was taken from 0.5 h
   filling to 1.5 h. reaction to 1.5 h. settlement to 0.5 h. discharge-idle
   periods. Average chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency of SBR
   of laboratory-scaled textile industry was 75%, whereas average turbidity
   and color removal (coloration number [RES, m(-1)] 586 nm) efficiencies
   were 90% and 75%, respectively. Optimum reaction and settlement periods
   were used in a real-scaled plant, and plant efficiency was examined for
   parameters such as COD, phenol, pH, mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS)
   and sludge volume index (SVI). In this study, optimum reaction and
   settlement periods for treatment of textile industry wastewater were
   determined within a SBR in a laboratory-scaled plant. These reaction and
   settlement periods were verified with the measurement of COD, color, and
   turbidity parameters. Floc structure and protozoa-metazoa species of
   activated sludge in a SBR were also determined. Optimum reaction and
   settlement times were used in a real-scaled plant, and plant efficiency
   was examined for COD, Phenol, pH, MLSS, and SVI parameters. The
   corresponding values were found as appropriate, acceptable, and
   meaningful because of variance value of statistical analysis.
   Protozoa and metazoan in the activated sludge in the laboratory-scaled
   plant were investigated. Peranema sp., Epistylis sp., Didinium sp.,
   Chilodonella sp., Opercularia sp., Vorticella sp. as protozoa species
   and Habrotrocha sp., Philodina sp. as metazoa species were determined.

   been employed as a model compounds for decolorization evaluation by
   exploring the correlation with the other rate-dependent environmental
   parameters. Through the measuring of color reduction by UV Vis
   spectroscopic monitoring analysis, the results revealed well operational
   properties of Streptomyces microflavus CKS6 for the successful
   refinement of dyes contaminate water solutions. Optimized process
   parameters were found to be apparently mild, involving the use of the
   reaction temperature of 27-30 degrees C and pH 6-7. With the lower dye
   concentrations, the decolorization efficiency was found to be more
   effective and rapid, wherein the 1 mg/L of Crystal violet was removed
   within the 2.5 h of the treatment time, while the solution with the same
   content of the Safranin T dye required 30 h. A possible mechanism for
   the working medium decolorization was accomplished in two consecutive
   steps, by the primarily dye adsorption onto the bacterial cells surface,
   followed to biodegradation by the active microbial enzymatic system,
   wherein the lignin peroxidase acts a notable role. The phytotoxicity
   analysis of the degradation products revealed less toxicity to the
   plants, compared to parental chemicals. In addition, the adaptation of
   individual dye optimized parameters was effectively implemented in the
   real waste water system containing the mixture of these two dyes. The
   overall results may postulate that Streptomyces microflavus CKS6 may be
   promising applicants for dye contaminated Water treatment. (C) 2017

   investigate the effect of various parameters including surface nitrogen
   content, the amine compounds chain length, contact time, initial
   concentration, solution pH and salt on the adsorption of Congo red.
   Results showed that the adsorption capacity of the sorbents did not
   increase consistently with the increase in the surface nitrogen content,
   and it varies in the order: unmodified < ethylenediamine-modified <
   diethylenetriamine-modified ae triethylenetetramine-modified ae
   tetraethylenepentamine-modified sugarcane bagasse. The
   diethylenetriamine-modified sorbent had similar capacity with the
   triethylenetetramine- and tetraethylenepentamine-modified sorbent. The
   adsorption mechanism based on electrostatic attraction and steric
   hindrance was proposed. pH and salt experiment illustrated that the
   prepared sorbents could be used in a wide pH range (5.0-12.0) and a
   high-salinity environment (1.0 mol L-1). Dynamic adsorption of Congo red
   on tetraethylenepentamine-modified SCB fixed-bed column showed that
   breakthrough time and saturated time were 364 and 1109 min,
   respectively. The modified SCB could be regenerated efficiently and used
   repeatedly. It had great potential in the real wastewater treatment.

AB In this study, CoFe2O4 nanoparticles supported on multi-walled carbon
   nanotubes (MWCNTs), as novel peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activator, were
   synthesized for degradation of Reactive Black 5 (RB5). The results
   showed that the maximum removal efficiencies of RB5 (100%), chemical
   oxygen demand (83.12%), and total organic carbon (65.5%) could happen at
   pH of 7, catalyst dosage of 100 mg/L, PMS dosage of 2 mM, RB5
   concentration of 50 mg/L, and time of 30 min. The results of the
   temperature effect showed that the activation energy (E-a = 20.92
   kJ/mol) for the synthesized catalyst is much lower compared to other
   studies. The PMS/MWCNTs-CoFe2O4 system had higher decolorization
   efficiency and kinetic rates compared to other adsorption and oxidation
   systems. Quenching experiments proved that RB5 was degraded by sulfate
   and hydroxyl radicals. The MWCNTs-CoFe2O4 catalyst showed suitable
   stability and reusability even after five consecutive catalytic
   reactions. The continuous treatment of RB5 in real water resources was
   performed using catalyst packed in a column reactor, and its results
   showed the high efficiency of the column in the catalytic treatment of
   the dye at long reaction time. Based on the proposed degradation
   pathway, the azo bands and the naphthalene structure of RB5 are oxidized
   to compounds with low molecular weight. Practitioner points
   MWCNTs-CoFe2O4 was used as a novel recyclable catalyst for the
   activation of peroxymonosulfate and dye degradation. The rate of dye
   degradation and peroxymonosulfate activation by MWCNTs-CoFe2O4 was much
   higher than that of the catalysts alone. Radical SO4 center dot-, with
   contribution percentage of 73.20%, was the main agent for degradation of
   Reactive Black 5 dye. MWCNTs-CoFe2O4 in the dye degradation process
   showed excellent stability and reusability, lower activation energy, and
   easier separation. The dye degradation products were identified by gas
   chromatography and UV-vis spectrophotometric analyses, and their
   degradation pathway was suggested.

AB Filamentous fungi are believed to remove a wide range of environmental
   xenobiotics due to their charac-teristically non-specific catabolic
   metabolisms. Nonetheless, irregular hyphal spreading can lead to
   clogging problems in treatment facilities and the dependence of
   pollutant bioavailability on hyphal surface features severely limits
   their applicability in water treatment. Here, we propose a scalable and
   facile methodology to structurally modify fungal hyphae, allowing for
   both the maximization of pollutant sorption and fungal pellet morphology
   self-regulation. Halloysite-doped mycelium architectures were
   efficiently constructed by dipping Aspergillus fumigatus pellets in
   halloysite nanotube-dispersed water. Ultrastructure analyses using
   scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray
   spectroscopy revealed that the nanotubes were mainly attached to the
   outer surface of the pellets. Fungal viability and exoenzyme production
   were hardly affected by the halloysites. Notably, nanotube doping
   appeared to be extremely robust given that detachments rarely occurred
   even in high concentrations of organic solvents and salt. It was also
   demonstrated that the doped halloysites weakened hyphal growth driven
   gelation, thus maintaining sphere-like pellet structures. The water
   treatment potential of the hybrid fungal mycelia was assessed through
   both cationic toxic organic/inorganic-contaminated water and real dye
   industry wastewater clean-ups. Aided by the mesoporous halloysite sites
   on their surface, the removal abilities of the hybrid structures were
   significantly enhanced. Moreover, inherent low sorption ability of HNT
   for heavy metals was found to be overcome by the aid of fungal mycelia.
   Finally, universal feature of the dipping-based doping way was confirmed
   by using different filamentous fungi. Given that traditional approaches
   to effectively implement fungus-based water treatment are based mostly
   on polymer-based immobilization techniques, our proposed approach
   provides a novel and effective alternative via simple doping of living
   fungi with environmentally-benign clays such as halloysite nanotubes.

AB Heavy metal ions and organic pollutants are hazardous contaminants
   commonly coexisted in various real wastewaters usually requiring complex
   and expensive treatment technologies. Herein, a novel low-cost
   agricultural by-product-based adsorbent, ethylenediaminetetraacetic
   acid-modified lotus seedpod (EDTA-LSP), was facilely synthesized and
   further utilized for the removal of toxic Pb2+ and malachite green (MG).
   In single pollutant systems, the EDTA-LSP showed considerably high
   adsorption capacities and rapid adsorption kinetics for Pb2+ (225.88 mg
   g(-1); 30 min) and MG (347.87 mg g(-1) ; 40 min), which could be rarely
   achieved simultaneously by many previously reported adsorbents.
   Particularly, the coexistence of Pb' and MG did not cause significant
   mutual interference, and high adsorption efficiencies for the two
   contaminants were still achieved. By a series of characterization
   analyses, it was revealed that the EDTA moieties on the adsorbent
   preferentially bound with Pb2+, and the formed EDTA-Pb' complexes could
   serve as effective sites for adsorption of cationic MG due to their
   negative charge nature. The differential binding behaviors, in turn,
   largely reduced the competition between the two contaminants and led to
   a quite satisfying coadsorption. Besides, this adsorbent could be reused
   several times without an obvious decrease in removal efficiencies for
   Pb2+ and MG. The low cost, simple synthesis, efficient
   adsorption/coadsorption, and excellent reusability indicate the EDTA-LSP
   is a promising adsorbent candidate for wastewater cleanup.

AB In this study, polyethylenimine-functionalized pyroxene nanoparticles
   (PEI-PNPs) were embedded into Diatomite (D4500), a commonly used filter
   aid, at <5 wt% to remove a dissolved commercial textile red dye (CRD)
   from wastewater in batch and continuous flow column experiments. An
   array of characterization techniques, such as XRD, BET, HRTEM, and SEM
   was carried out for the Diatomite embedded nanoparticles. The filter aid
   was mainly composed of macroporous diatomaceous earth, its adsorption
   surface area and capacity for the CRD were improved significantly via
   embedding more PEI-PNPs. The adsorption isotherms in the batch studies
   were fairly explained by the Sips model. The adsorption performance of
   the fixed-bed column was tested for D4500, before and after embedding it
   with virgin and PEI-functionalized pyroxene nanoparticles, to determine
   the breakthrough curves under different operational conditions (e.g.,
   inlet concentration of CRD, inlet flow rate, bed height, and
   nanoparticle concentration in Diatomite, %nps). The
   convection-dispersion transport equation was used to describe the
   obtained breakthrough curves, which enabled the determination of the
   axial dispersion coefficient (D-L) and the Peclet number (Pe).
   Additionally, the breakthrough data was analyzed using the equivalent
   length of unused bed (H-UNB) approach. In this approach Pe was
   correlated with H-UNB with a good accuracy with the correlation: H-UNB=
   0.013Pe + 1.25 when Q and C-0 are the operational control parameters,
   while the correlation: H-UNB = 4.08e(-0.002Pe) when Z and %nps are the
   operational control parameters. These correlations can be helpful and
   useful for scaling up our proposed process for real industrial
   applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Industrial paint wastewater (IPW) contains highly toxic and high

   an effective approach for organic removal from a bench scale test by
   Fenton integrated with oxic/hydrolysis acidification/oxic (FT-O/HA/O)
   bioprocess. Then, the performance of the integrated FT-O/HA/O process
   was evaluated in a real IPW treatment plant: a significant COD removal
   of 97.3% was achieved, making the effluent COD stabilized at 430 mg/L in
   average (below discharge standard 500 mg/L). In the mechanism study,
   organic compounds degradation pathway was proposed using gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) which revealed that the various
   kinds of linear hydrocarbon appeared after the first stage aerobic stage
   (O-1). Meanwhile, considerable amounts of aromatic organic matters with
   benzene rings were degraded after Fenton and O-1 stage.
   Excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectra indicated that the
   Fenton and O-1 stage significantly reduced the fluorescence intensity of
   proteinaceous tryptophan-like matter. Furthermore, the molecular weight
   distribution elucidated that the biodegradable small weight organics
   were dominated in the following HA/O process. Microbial community
   structures revealed that Proteobacteria became the most dominant phylum
   in all stages, whereas Acetobacter, Brachymonas, Sphingobium and
   Novosphingobium, as the crucial contaminant degraders, proliferated in
   the microbial consortium of O/HA/O bioprocess, making the overall
   integration system more effective and reliable.

   sonocatalytic activity of bentonite-supported ZnO nanoparticles (BSZNs)
   in comparison with the suspended ZnO nanoparticles (SZNs). The particle
   size of BSZNs (5-40 nm) was lower than that of SZNs (20-120 nm). Due to
   the immobilization of ZnO nanoparticles, a specific surface area of 80.6
   m(2)/g was obtained for the BSZNs, which was higher than the specific
   surface area of the raw bentonite (42.2 m(2)/g). Optimization of the
   process via response surface methodology (RSM) based on central
   composite design (CCD) showed the maximum sonocatalytic decolorization
   efficiency (%) of 89.92% in which the initial dye concentration, the
   ZnO/bentonite ratio, the sonocatalyst dosage, and the initial pH were 6
   mg/L, 0.3, 2.5 and 9, respectively. The byproducts generated during the

AB BACKGROUND: A filamentous fungus Neurospora sitophila was immobilized in
   Zea mays silk tissue and the prepared system was employed as a new

   RESULTS: Decolorization potential of the biosorbent system was
   investigated in batch and continuous mode operations. Design parameters
   such as pH, biomass dosage, contact time, temperature, dye concentration
   and flow rate were investigated. Batch mode equilibrium data were
   analyzed kinetically to determine the rate constants. The process
   followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The thermodynamics of
   the biosorption indicated the spontaneous and endothermic nature of the
   process. Biosorption was well described by the Langmuir isotherm model,
   with a maximum monolayer biosorption capacity of 105.33 mg g(-1).
   Relatively good dynamic flow decolorization potential was observed for
   the biosorbent system in synthetic and real wastewater conditions. Flow
   mode regeneration studies over ten consecutive cycles indicated that the
   suggested biosorbent maintained consistently high biosorption yield,
   above 70%. The possible dye-biosorbent interaction mechanism was also
   confirmed by zeta potential, FTIR, SEM and EDX analysis.
   CONCLUSION: High biosorption capacity and regeneration potential suggest
   that the new biosorbent system can be used as an alternative and
   low-cost biomaterial for the treatment of reactive dye contaminated
   solutions. (C) 2011 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Microbial energy generation systems, i.e., bioelectrochemical systems
   (BESs) are promising sustainable technologies that have been used in
   different fields of application such as biofuel production, biosensor,
   nutrient recovery, wastewater treatment, and heavy metals removal.
   However, BESs face great challenges such as large-scale application in
   real time, low power performance, and suitable materials for their
   configuration. This review paper aimed to discuss the use of BES systems
   such as conventional microbial fuel cells (MFCs), as well as plant
   microbial fuel cell (P-MFC), sediment microbial fuel cell (S-MFC),
   constructed wetland microbial fuel cell (CW-MFC), osmotic microbial fuel
   cell (OsMFC), photo-bioelectrochemical fuel cell (PBFC), and MFC-Fenton
   systems in the zero waste sustainable recovery process. Firstly, the
   configuration and electrode materials used in BESs as the main sources
   to improve the performance of these technologies are discussed.
   Additionally, zero waste recovery process from solid and wastewater
   feedstock, i.e., energy recovery: electricity generation (from 12 to
   26,680 mW m(-2)) and fuel generation, i.e., H-2 (170 +/- 2.7 L-1 L-1
   d(-1)) and CH4 (107.6 +/- 3.2 mL(-1) g(-1)), nutrient recovery of 100%
   (PO43-P), and 13-99% (NH4+-N), heavy metal removal/recovery: water
   recovery, nitrate (100%), sulfate (53-99%), and sulfide recovery/removal
   (99%), antibiotic, dye removal, and other product recovery are
   critically analyzed in this review paper. Finally, the perspective and
   challenges, and future outlook are highlighted. There is no doubt that
   BES technologies are an economical option for the simultaneous zero
   waste elimination and energy recovery. However, more research is
   required to carry out the large-scale application of BES, as well as
   their commercialization.

AB The presence of emerging pollutants such as PO43- and NO3- in water
   bodies has attracted worldwide concern about their severe effects on
   water bodies and the health of humankind in general. Therefore, to
   preserve the health of humankind and environmental safety, it is of the
   essence that industrial effluents are treated before they are discharged
   into water bodies. Amine functionalized walnut shells (ACWNS) were
   synthesized, characterized, and then tested as a novel adsorbent for
   PO43- and NO3- removal. The effects of pH, dosage, initial phosphate
   concentration, interference ions, and temperature on the removal of
   phosphate and nitrate were investigated. Notably, the adsorption of
   PO43- and NO3- was exothermic and spontaneous, with a maximum uptake
   capacity of phosphate and nitrate, at 293 K, 82.2 and 35.7 mg g(-1),
   respectively. The mechanism by which these ions were adsorbed onto ACWNS
   could be electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding.
   Pseudo-second-order kinetic model fitted the PO43- and NO3- adsorption,
   while Freundlich and Langmuir models best fitted the PO43- and NO3-
   adsorption, respectively. Furthermore, in the binary system, the uptake
   capacity of phosphate decreased by 14.4% while nitrate witnessed a
   reduction in its uptake capacity of 10.4%. ACWNS has a higher attraction
   towards both ions and this could be attributed to the existence of a
   variety of active areas on ACWNS that exhibit a degree of specificity
   for the individual ions. Results obtained from real water sample
   analysis confirmed ACWNS as highly efficient to be utilized for
   practical remediation processes.

AB Developing green inexpensive and effective adsorbents is critically
   needed for elimination of antibiotics from contaminated water. The
   current study assessed the nanostructured activated biochar (nPPAB)
   derived from pomegranate peels (PP) as a promising sorbent for efficient
   removal of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP). The results affirm that
   the second order and Langmuir models fit well to adsorption kinetics and
   equilibrium data respectively. The nPPAB adsorption capacity of Langmuir
   (qmax) for CIP was 142.86 mg g-1 which is 26.85 times greater than that
   of bulk PP. Hydrogen bonding, pi-pi interaction, hydrophobic and
   electrostatic interactions are the dominant mechanisms of CIP adsorption
   by nPPAB. The efficiency of nPPAB for CIP removal from real wastewater
   using batch and packed-bed reactor were 89.94 and 84.74% respectively.
   This study clearly demonstrated the substantial capacity of nPPAB as an
   ecofriendly, feasible, and in-expensive adsorbent for successful
   elimination of CIP from wastewater.

AB Inadequately treated or untreated wastewater greatly contribute to the
   release of unwanted toxic contaminants into water bodies. Some of these
   contaminants are persistent and bioaccumulative, becoming a great
   concern as they are released into the environment. Despite the abundance
   of wastewater treatment technologies, the adsorption method overall has
   proven to be an excellent way to treat wastewater from multiple industry
   sources. Because of its significant benefits, i.e., easy availability,
   handling, and higher efficiency with a low cost relative to other
   treatments, adsorption is opted as the best method to be used. However,
   biosorption using naturally found seaweeds has been proven to have
   promising results in removing pollutants, such as dyes from textile,
   paper, and the printing industry, nitrogen, and phosphorous and phenolic
   compounds, as well as heavy metals from various sources. Due to its
   ecofriendly nature together with the availability and inexpensiveness of
   raw materials, biosorption via seaweed has become an alternative to the
   existing technologies in removing these pollutants from wastewater
   effectively. In this article, the use of low-cost adsorbent (seaweed)
   for the removal of pollutants from wastewater has been reviewed. An
   extensive table summarises the applicability of seaweed in treating
   wastewater. Literature reported that the majority of research used
   simulated wastewater and minor attention has been given to biosorption
   using seaweed in the treatment of real wastewater.

AB Phenol is a major component in the scrubber wastewater used for syngas
   purification in biomass-based gasification plants. Adsorption is a
   common strategy for wastewater purification, and carbon materials, such
   as activated carbons and biochar, may be used for its remediation. In
   this work, we compare the adsorption behavior towards phenol of two
   biochar samples, produced by pyrolysis and gasification of
   lignocellulose biomass, with two commercial activated carbons. Obtained
   data were also used to assess the effect of textural properties (i.e.,
   surface area) on phenol removal. Continuous tests in lab-scale columns
   were also carried out and the obtained data were processed with
   literature models in order to obtain design parameters for scale-up.
   Results clearly indicate the superiority of activated carbons due to the
   higher pore volume, although biomass-derived char may be more suitable
   from an economic and environmental point of view. The phenol adsorption
   capacity increases from about 65 m/g for gasification biochar to about
   270 mg/g for the commercial activated carbon. Correspondingly, service
   time of commercial activated carbons was found to be about six times
   higher than that of gasification biochar. Finally, results indicate that
   phenol may be used as a model for characterizing the adsorption capacity
   of the investigated carbon materials, but in the case of real waste
   water the carbon usage rate should be considered at least 1.5 times
   higher than that calculated for phenol.

AB BACKGROUND: Based on promising results obtained at laboratory scale with
   a two-step electrochemical treatment of Tartrazine solutions by
   electrocoagulation (EC) coupled with electrochemical advanced oxidation
   processes (EAOPs), this work addresses its scale-up to degrade 1.85
   dm(3) of solutions of this dye. Monopolar and bipolar configurations
   have been compared in EC. The effect of supporting electrolyte, pH,
   applied current, dye concentration and electrolysis time has been
   assessed.
   RESULTS: Electrocoagulation with four Fe electrodes was first optimized
   for the treatment of 278 mg dm(-3) Tartrazine solutions. The bipolar
   series configuration led to enhanced coagulation due to the larger
   electrode consumption. Solutions with 0.05 mol dm(-3) NaCl at pH 6.3
   were quickly decolorized with 60% total organic carbon removal, being
   more convenient than Na2SO4 and NaNO3 electrolytes due to the
   synergistic action of coagulation and oxidation by active chlorine.
   Among the EAOPs, carried out with a Ti/IrO2-RuO2 anode and an
   air-diffusion cathode to electrogenerate H2O2, electro-Fenton (EF) with
   0.5 mmol dm(-3) Fe2+ was much better than electro-oxidation owing to the
   oxidative action of active chlorine and (OH)-O-center dot formed in the
   bulk from Fenton's reaction. Photoelectro-Fenton (PEF) was even better
   by the additional photolysis of by-products under incident UVA photons.
   CONCLUSIONS: The use of an EC reactor in bipolar configuration for 12.5
   min at 1.50 A followed by PEF treatment for 360 min at 1.50-2.00 A
   ensured mineralization >90%, which encourages further optimization at
   larger scale for the treatment of a variety of organic pollutants in
   real wastewaters. (C) 2014 Society of Chemical Industry

AB In the present work, biological hydroxyapatite (Bio-HAp) was generated
   from waste poultry bone and modified with magnesium oxide (MgO)
   nanoparticles (Bio-HAp/MgO) and used in the adsorption process of methyl
   violet (MV). The Bio-HAp and Bio-HAp/MgO mesoporous composites were
   characterized using physicochemical techniques. Bio-HAp and Bio-HAp/MgO
   composites had crystalline and mesoporous structures. The specific
   surface area of Bio-HAp/MgO mesoporous composites (14.7 m(2)/g) was
   higher and lower than that of Bio-HAp (4.6 m(2)/g) and MgO (154.9
   m(2)/g), respectively. The effect of pH (2-10), temperature (25-45
   degrees C), contact time (10-50 min), initial MV concentration (5-25
   mg/L), and Bio-HAp/MgO quantity (0.5-2.5 g/L) on the adsorption
   efficiency was optimized through response surface methodology-central
   composite design (RSM-CCD). Among four isotherm models, the Freundlich
   isotherm (R-2 > 0.98) was better matched with the equilibrium data.
   Based on the isotherm parameters (E,n, and R-L), the MV adsorption
   process using Bio-HAp particles and Bio-HAp/MgO mesoporous composites is
   physical and desirable. The pseudo-second-order (R-2 > 0.97) was more
   potent than the other models for modeling kinetic data. According to the
   thermodynamic investigation, the MV adsorption was an exothermic and
   spontaneous process. The mesoporous composite had good reusability to
   remove MV dye from liquid media up to 5 steps. Bio-HAp particles and
   Bio-HAp/MgO mesoporous composites were tested for treatment, which
   significantly reduced the dye content of the real sample.

AB Fenton method is well recognized for organic pollutant degradation.
   However, traditional Fenton method has several drawbacks for practical
   application. In this regard different catalysts and modified Fenton
   processes are developed for better efficiency. In this study, a new
   catalyst is developed for methylene blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO)
   degradation under heterogeneous photo-Fenton process in presence of H2O2
   and visible light. Finally, the catalyst was successfully applied for
   real textile wastewater degradation also. Here the as-prepared catalyst
   is the Co(II), which is adsorbed on the bilayer structure of sodium
   dodecyl sulfate (an anionic surfactant) formed on alumina support. The
   catalyst is designated as Co-SMA. The degradation characteristics of
   both the dyes are discussed. The MB, being a cationic dye, gets fully
   adsorbed on Co-SMA surface and the reaction proceeds on the solid
   surface with zero order kinetics. On the other hand, the degradation of
   MO follows first order kinetics because of its low adsorption. The
   efficiency of decolorization of real wastewater is found to be > 92% in
   60 min time of reaction with 10 g L-1 of Co-SMA, 37.9 mM H2O2 and 10,010
   lx light intensity. Leaching of cobalt from Co-SMA is very less during
   the reaction which is advantageous for environmental applications.

AB Plant-derived coagulants have exhibited a good potential in wastewater
   treatment due to their "green" characteristics, high
   coagulating-flocculating activity, cost-effectiveness, and
   biodegradability. Nevertheless, research studies have focused mainly on
   bench-scale experiments; pilot-scale and full-scale simulations are
   still limited. Herein, we firstly report a pilot-scale study of real
   domestic textile wastewater treatment using Cassia fistula coagulant.
   The material characterizations using Fourier-transform infrared
   spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and dynamic
   light scattering (DLS) revealed that the natural gum extracted from C.
   fistula seed possessed a rough and irregular surface containing a high
   molecular weight galactomannan. The bench-scale investigation was
   initially conducted to determine the optimal pollutant concentration,
   initial pH, and coagulant dosage in the coagulation-flocculation
   process. The pilot-scale study revealed that C. fistula coagulant is an
   effective material for real textile wastewater treatment, showing
   percentage removal of 93.83% at a volume of 30 L and a coagulant dosage
   of 1.17 mg center dot L-1. Coagulation-flocculation using C. fistula
   seed gum could be an efficient primary wastewater treatment prior to
   membrane or biological methods to meet Vietnamese environmental
   standards. The main mechanisms of textile wastewater treatment involve
   adsorption/bridging interactions via hydrogen bonding and electrostatic
   attraction between negatively charged carboxylate groups of the
   coagulant and positively charged pollutants.

AB Multifunctional ultrafiltration membranes need to be further developed
   with ultrafiltration performance and high multifunctional
   decontamination efficiency. Here, the MIL-PVDF multifunctional
   ultrafiltration membrane with ultrahigh MIL loading was demonstrated by
   a new blending method of predispersion in acetone and thermally induced
   phase separation. Due to the improved dispersity and restriction of pore
   size, the MIL-53(Fe) mass loading was as high as approximately 61%. The
   new membrane showed high performance for methylene blue (MB) removal and
   maintained high permeability and ultrafiltration efficiency. The
   characteristics of the membranes were analyzed to explain the above
   advantages. Meanwhile, compared to the traditional blend ultrafiltration
   membrane, the 67-MIL-PVDF membrane showed an 9-fold increase in
   effective treatment volume for more than 75% MB removal. The
   contribution and efficiency of adsorption and catalytic oxidation were
   analyzed and explained. The relationship between them was confirmed as
   being independent, and the reasons for this independence were proposed.
   Additionally, the mechanism of multifunctional decontamination and
   permeability by MIL-PVDF membranes was proposed. Moreover, the
   67-MIL-PVDF membrane was also suitable for long-term run and real
   wastewaters treatment. In conclusion, this study sheds new light on the
   preparation strategy for multifunctional blend ultrafiltration membranes

AB This work aimed at providing additional information and knowledge on the
   possibility to overcome the limitation of conventional advanced
   oxidation processes (AOPs) through hybridization. In the present work, a
   number of photochemical and non-photochemical AOPs such as direct
   photolysis (UV), photolysis of hydrogen peroxide using UV light
   (UV/H2O2), UV assisted coagulation (UV- Fe2+ coagulation), Fenton
   process, Fe2+ coagulation and photo-Fenton process were compared to
   determine their feasibility to treat real textile wastewater. The Batik
   industry, which is a textile cottage industry in Malaysia has reported
   problems related to safe environmental disposal of its pollutants,
   mainly dyestuff. The comparison was made in terms of Chemical oxygen
   demand (COD), Total organic carbon (TOC) and colour removal together
   with electricity consumption. Among the processes evaluated, the highest
   COD removal was achieved for photo-Fenton oxidation (91.2%), followed by
   Fenton oxidation (81.4%), UV/H2O2 (68.0%), UV- Fe2+ coagulation (55.0%),
   Fe2+ coagulation (43.0%) and UV photolysis (10.0%). At the optimal
   operating conditions (room temperature, undiluted contaminants), the
   photo-Fenton hybrid process achieved complete decolourization and higher
   removal of COD (91.2%) and TOC (78.5%) with minimum electrical energy
   per order of 0.02 kWhr/m(3) compared to other AOPs. About 13% reduction
   in the total chemical cost and 10% increase in the degradation were
   observed by combining the Fenton process with UV radiation compared to
   the conventional Fenton process. The GC/MS analysis revealed that the
   photo-Fenton process successfully removed 87% of organic compounds. The
   sludge characterization studies by Particle Size Distribution proved
   that the Fenton-generated sludge achieved quality suitable for disposal.
   Photo-Fenton is the cheapest option with highest removal (91%) as its
   required only $0.0016 to degrade 1 g of COD compared to Fenton which
   cost $0.0021. Therefore, this study concluded that the photo-Fenton
   process was an economically viable and appropriate treatment method for
   enhancing biodegradability of recalcitrant contaminants. (C) 2018

AB Heavy metals pollutants are nonbiodegradable and their bioaccumulation
   results in detrimental environmental consequences. Therefore, it is
   important to effectively remove toxic heavy metal waste from industrial
   sewage. Thus, the main goal of this research is to synthesize an ideal
   cellulose-based adsorbent from palm-based waste materials (agro waste)
   in order to be utilized in real-life practical applications with low
   cost as such removing common toxic heavy metals from industrial
   effluents. A poly(methyl acrylate) grafted palm cellulose was
   synthesized via a free-radical initiation process, followed by an
   oximation reaction to yield poly(hydroxamic acid) ligands. The
   adsorption capacity (q(e)) of poly(hydroxamic acid) ligands for metal
   ions such as copper (Cu2+), iron (Fe3+), and lead (Pb2+) were 325, 220,
   and 300 mg g(-1), respectively at pH 6. In addition, the X-ray
   photoelectron spectrometry results are to be proved the binding of metal
   ions, for instance, Cu(II) ions showed typically significant BEs of
   932.7 and 952.0 eV corresponding to the Cu2p3/2 and Cu2p1/2 species. The
   heavy metal ions adsorption followed a pseudo-first-order kinetic model
   pathway. The adsorption capacity (q(m)) is also derived from the
   Langmuir isotherm linear plot, which does not showed good correction
   coefficients. However, the results were correlated to the Freundlich
   isotherm model, where theR(2)value showed significance (>0.98),
   indicating that multiple layer adsorption occurs on the synthesized
   ligand. The synthesized polymeric ligand is an excellent adsorbent for
   the removal of heavy metals from the industrial wastewater. In addition,
   the metal analysis results showed that about 98% removal of copper and
   iron ions from electroplating wastewater including lead, nickel, and
   chromium can be removed up to 85-97%.

AB A series of advanced oxidation processes were applied to degrade a
   typical pollutant of industrial effluents known as Ponceau 4R. For this,
   a magnetic Fenton catalyst was prepared by co-precipitation of Fe2+ and
   Fe3+ ions over activated carbon. This catalyst was characterized by XRD,
   FTIR, VSM and applied in oxidation processes involving the use of ozone,
   hydrogen peroxide and solar light. Experiments were carried out at
   laboratory scale in a semi-continuous reactor loaded with a solution of
   50 mg L-1 of Ponceau 4R in different water matrices (deionized water,
   domestic wastewater and seawater) and bubbled with air or an ozone-air
   mixture. When used, the initial concentration of H2O2 was 3.3 x 10(-2)
   mol L-1 and that of the catalyst was 500 mg L-1. Results show that
   Ponceau 4R does not photolyze under solar radiation, it is not directly
   oxidized by H2O2 (in the dark) but it can be partially or entirely
   degraded through photo-Fenton and ozone-based oxidation processes.
   Taking into account the initial depletion rate of azo groups
   concentration and colour removal yield, the efficiency of the tested
   systems follows the order: hydrogen peroxide photolysis < photo-Fenton
   process < peroxone < ozonation < catalytic ozonation approximate to
   photocatalytic ozonation. Ponceau 4R was also completely removed from
   real domestic wastewater and seawater samples, which were doped with
   this compound and subjected to photocatalytic ozonation treatment, in
   less than 60 min of reaction time, when the matrices pH was previously
   adjusted to 3. However, when applied at the natural pH of these water
   matrices (8 and 8.7, respectively), the pollutant conversion was 80%.

AB Mytella falcata shells were used as adsorbent to remove
   17-alpha-methyltestosterone from water. Preliminary tests were carried
   out to evaluate the affinity of the mollusk shells in their natural,
   pyrolyzed and calcined form in relation to the hormone. Pyrolyzed
   material showed the best performance. The influence of the solution pH
   and the adsorbent load were also evaluated. The material was
   characterized by thermogravimetry, Fourier Transform Infrared
   Spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Point of Zero charge and Scanning
   Electron Microscopy. Adsorption assays reveals better kinetic fit for
   pseudo second order, with mechanism follow diffusion in bulk and
   intraparticle, while the Sips model presented a better fit to the
   equilibrium experimental data. The maximum adsorption capacity reached
   0.778 mg.g(-1) at 50 degrees C. The process takes place in an exothermic
   way, being governed by forces from chemical nature, as indicated by the
   thermodynamic parameters. The artificial neural network with one hidden
   layer and three neurons showed up a promising tool in predicting
   equilibrium relationships of the adsorptive process. The neural model
   was equivalent to the isotherms models found in literature used to
   predict the adsorption kinetics and adsorption equilibrium. In terms of
   removal percentage, the adsorbent showed promising results achieving 70%
   for ultrapure water. On the other hand, when real water matrices were
   applied, the lower removal occurred with lagoon water (30%), and the
   highest removal was achieved using mineral water (80%), indicating this
   waste material as good alternative for the removal of endocrine
   disruptors from different types of water.

AB This study investigated the performance of organic pollutant degradation
   using the electro-Fenton process and low-cost titanium (Ti) electrodes
   as cathodes. Three Ti electrodes with different morphologies, i.e., a
   plate and two meshes with large (MS-L) and small (MS-S) opening sizes,
   were evaluated using electrochemical characterization, as well as
   kinetic and energy studies based on the COD removal performance of the
   electro-Fenton process. The preliminary results indicated that the MS-S
   electrode, which has the largest electrochemically active surface area
   and lowest resistance amongst the three electrodes, could reduce Fe3+ to
   Fe2+ most effectively in the synthetic solution. However, when treating
   real wastewater, MS-L rather than MS-S exhibited 13.8% higher COD
   removal efficiency with a 1.5-fold higher rate constant (i.e., 0.0362
   min(-1)) during the initial 30 min of the electro-Fenton process. This
   unexpected anomaly was due to excessive clogging by suspended solids
   (SS) present in the real wastewater that were easily captured by the
   narrow openings of MS-S. Consequently, a pilot-scale electro-Fenton
   system was operated using MS-L. The pilot experiment demonstrated stable
   degradation of organic pollutants for five consecutive months with an
   average COD removal efficiency of 86%, showing its feasibility in
   treating real wastewater. With its competitive regeneration of Fe2+, low
   manufacturing cost and energy consumption, the electro-Fenton process
   using Ti mesh with large opening sizes appears to be a viable and
   practical technology for wastewater treatment.

AB In this work, a novel cascade system (i.e., SnTCPP/g-C3N4/Bi2WO6) is
   successfully constructed using stannum (II) meso-tetra (4-carboxyphenyl)
   porphyrin (SnTCPP) as the key photovoltaic agent for the first time.
   Visible light driven photocatalytic experiments indicated that wt. 12%
   SnTCPP and 30% Bi2WO6 codecorated g-C3N4 demonstrates the highest
   photodecomposition capabilities for levofloxacin and rhodamine B,
   achieving 85.64% and 93.64% degradation rates, respectively. The
   dramatically enhanced photocatalytic performance mainly raised from the
   synergetic co-effects among SnTCPP, g-C3N4 and Bi2WO6, including: i) the
   incorporation of SnTCPP extends the visible light response of the binary
   Bi2WO6/g-C3N4 heterojunctions, resulting in the highly efficient visible
   light harvesting; ii) we find that the g-C3N4 not only serves as a
   promising supporter to trap electrons from Bi2WO6, but also as an
   interfacial electron-hole pairs transfer moderator, like "volleyball
   setter" to facilitate the charges transfer between Bi2WO6 and SnTCPP.
   The presence of the "setter" endows a cascade system for boosting the
   photodegradation efficiency of levofloxacin and rhodamine B. This study
   provides a promising design strategy to construct efficient g-C3N4 based
   heterojunctions suitable for removing pharmaceutical antibiotics and
   hazardous dyes from various real wastewaters.

AB 4-Nitrophenol (4-NP) is an extensively utilized industrial chemical and
   one of major toxic water pollutant. Therefore, there is an urgent need
   to monitor the levels of 4-NP from environmental samples as well as its
   eradication are extremely important. Keeping this as a motivation, this
   research for the first-time reports microwave-assisted cost-effective
   synthesis of silver oxide (Ag2O)-zinc oxide (ZnO) composite nanocones
   (CNCs, 80-100 nm) for simultaneous electrochemical detection and
   photodegradation of 4-NP from aqueous solutions. The Ag2O-ZnO CNCs
   modified gold electrode was fabricated for electrochemical detection of
   4-NP. Such fabricated sensor exhibited a sensitivity of 1.6 mu A mu M-1
   cm(-2), wide linear detection range of 0.4-26 mu M & 28-326 mu M, and a
   low limit of detection of 23 nM. The sensor also exhibited good
   selectivity in real water samples. Also, an outstanding photocatalytic
   performance of Ag2O-ZnO CNCs was evaluated towards UV-assisted
   degradation of 4-NP and organic water pollutant dye, methylene blue. The
   Ag2O-ZnO CNCs exhibited excellent electro- and photocatalytic activities
   due to the formation of p-n nano-heterojunction comprising of p-type
   Ag2O and n-type ZnO semiconductor nanoparticles within the composite.
   Therefore, herein reported smart CNCs can be projected as applied
   nano-system for cost-effective and rapid simultaneous detection and
   removal of 4-NP from aqueous solutions. Such nano-system can be useful
   for industrial application where detection and removal of 4-NP is a key
   issue to resolve.

AB The aim of the study was to prepare a novel adsorbent by chemical
   modification of hazelnut shells and evaluate its potential for the
   nitrate removal from model solutions and real wastewater. The
   characterization of the novel adsorbent, i.e., modified hazelnut shell
   (MHS) was performed. The adsorbent characterization included the
   analysis of elemental composition and the surface characteristics
   analysis by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The adsorption experiments (batch
   technique) were performed to investigate the effects of adsorbent
   concentration, contact time, initial nitrate concentration, and solution
   pH. The nitrate removal efficiency increased with the increase in MHS
   concentration and decreased with the initial nitrate concentration. MHS
   was found to be effective in nitrate removal over a wide pH range (from
   2 to 10), and the highest amount of nitrate adsorbed was 25.79 mg g(-1)
   in a model nitrate solution. Depending on the aqueous medium (model
   solutions or real wastewater samples), it was shown that both Langmuir
   and Freundlich adsorption isotherm models can be used to interpret the
   adsorption process. It was found that the kinetics are well described by
   a pseudo-second order model and the nitrate adsorption process can be
   controlled by chemisorption. The intraparticle diffusion model has been
   used to identify an adsorption-controlled process by diffusion
   mechanisms. Adsorption/desorption experiments in column confirmed that
   MHS could be successfully used in multiple cycles (at least three),
   indicating the potential of MHS as an alternative to costly commercial
   adsorbents for the removal of nitrates from wastewater.

AB It was demonstrated in this study that appropriate concentrations of
   oxalate (Ox) would lead to greatly accelerated electro-generation of
   Fe2+ but obviously lower power consumption in the Fered-Fenton system.
   Depending on the Ti electrode with pristine TiO2 layer, effects of
   important parameters on the SMX degradation were investigated in the
   Fered-Fenton-Ox system. It was found that the heterogeneous interfacial
   electrochemically reduction of Fe-III was critical in the
   Fered-Fenton-Ox system relying on the surface hydroxyl bonding Fe-III-Ox
   and formation of Fe-O-Ti bonds. A heterogeneous-homogeneous reaction
   mechanism was therefore proposed. It included the heterogeneous
   interfacial electrochemical generation of Fe-II-Ox and the
   heterogeneous-homogenous Fenton oxidation of pollutants. The promotional
   role of Ox would be also homogenous and heterogeneous, i.e. maintaining
   ferric at higher pH and forming specific Fe-III-Ox complex as well as
   accelerating the solid-liquid interfacial heterogeneous iron cycle.
   Furthermore, a continuous-flow pilot study was conducted in treating a
   printing and dyeing industrial wastewater. As compared to conventional
   Fenton and Fered-Fenton systems, the Fered-Fenton-Ox system could
   achieve more efficient COD removal with a relative low cost/Delta COD,
   suggesting great advantages in its practical applications for treating
   real industrial complex wastewaters.

AB A new magnetic bio-based composite was designed by the magnetic
   modification of passively immobilized fungal cells. It was utilized for
   biosorptive decolorization of reactive dye-contaminated aquatic media.
   As a greener option, waste tea leaf tissues were used for the first time
   as an immobilization matrix for microbial cells. Immobilized magnetic
   cells (biomagsorbent) could be effectively used in both batch and
   dynamic flow mode treatment processes and real environmental
   application. Rapid equilibrium and high decolorization yields were
   observed for the target dye (reactive violet 1). The temperature did not
   significantly affect the process. Langmuir and the pseudo-second-order
   models could be better used to fit the process equilibrium and kinetics,
   respectively. Maximum monolayer sorption capacity was 152.88 mg g(-1).
   High biosorption and desorption yields for 50 consecutive dynamic flow
   decolorization cycles were recorded as striking results. The
   breakthrough time was 3420 min. Simulated and industrial water treatment
   performance of biomagsorbent was found to be more than 90%. The
   mechanism was evaluated by IR and zeta potential analysis. The magnetic
   character of the sorbent provided good mechanical durability, easy
   separation, and excellent regeneration ability. Consequently, this work
   provides new insight into scalar enhancement of water treatment.

AB Ensuring high quality of water is an urgent challenge for today's
   research. In spite of the enormous progress achieved in the area, the
   quest for all-in-one systems able to adsorb, detect and degrade
   pollutants has not been sufficiently accomplished. Here, we present
   multi-functional plasmonic hydrogels composed of
   beta-cyclodextrin-functionalized silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) embedded
   within bubbles made of alginate. The synergistic combination of
   individual building blocks enables multi-purpose systems to be obtained:
   the alginate matrix ensures good adsorption properties,
   beta-cyclodextrins (beta CD) act as molecular receptors and Ag NPs
   enable the pollutant detection through surface enhanced Raman
   spectroscopy (SERS) and its plasmon-assisted photo-degradation. Their
   activity has been tested during the capture, detection and
   photodegradation of methylene blue and sulfamethoxazole, but the general
   affinity of beta CD receptors towards benzene and heterocyclic rings
   makes these nanocomposite hydrogels extremely versatile scavengers for
   most of the common organic pollutants, including biphenyls, other dyes
   and pharmaceutical compounds. In addition, their stability, ease of
   manipulation, dispersion and recovery make these systems ideal for both
   in situ and ex situ applications, enabling water-treatment under real
   conditions.

AB BACKGROUND The importance of potable water is immeasurable and its
   contamination by pollutants is a serious environmental problem.
   Rhodamine B (RhB), one such pollutant, is highly toxic to various
   organisms and may cause long-term undesirable effects when improperly
   disposed of. Thus, development of an efficient treatment technique is
   necessary. Among the new oxidation methods, heterogeneous photocatalysis
   is an emerging pollutant destructive technology. RESULTS The
   photocatalytic activities of copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) aluminate spinels
   (CuAl2O4 and ZnAl2O4) was evaluated. Chemical and physical properties
   were considered, and ZnAl2O4 showed higher RhB degradation efficiency
   (73.90% in only 10 min) than CuAl2O4 (51.95% in 10 min), reaching up to
   100% in 30 min. According to results, a further RhB catalytic
   degradation pathway by ZnAl2O4 was monitored by UV-visible spectrometry
   and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to diode array
   detection (UHPLC-DAD) analysis. When applied to wastewater from gemstone
   beneficiation, containing elevated RhB concentration, the ZnAl2O4 caused
   88% color removal in 120 min and its pollutant removal rate was 18 times
   greater than the commonly used ZnO. CONCLUSION The superior performance
   of ZnAl2O4 can be attributed to better pore properties, responsible for
   providing more active sites. These identified reactive oxygen species
   (ROS)-induced interactions and the species demonstrated that degradation
   occurs due to generation of O-2(center dot-) and h(+). Thus, ZnAl2O4
   proved to be an efficient photocatalyst for quick RhB pollutant
   degradation with promising potential for real wastewater treatment
   applications. (c) 2019 Society of Chemical Industry

AB In this study, commercial and lab-prepared TiO2 were modified by
   fluorination and platinum photodeposition; and the effect of these
   modifications over the physicochemical and photocatalytic properties of
   TiO2 was evaluated. It was found that F and Pt addition leads to the
   modification of the optical and textural properties of TiO2. The
   materials prepared were tested in the photocatalytic degradation of
   different organic dyestuffs such as methylene blue (MB) and methyl
   orange (MO); the degradation of commercial anilines employed in the
   staining of natural fibers was also evaluated. Photocatalysis was also
   studied in this work as an eco-friendly treatment of wastewater coming
   from handicrafts factories. In general it was observed that the
   effectiveness of the photocatalytic treatment strongly depends on the
   substrate to be degraded, thus, fluorinated and platinized commercial
   Titania (Pt-F-P25) showed the best photocatalytic performance in the MB
   and MO photodegradation and in contrast, in the case of the anilines the
   highest degradation was obtained over commercial TiO2 fluorinated
   (F-P25). These results can be explained by differences observed in the
   structure and in the adsorption of these dyestuffs over the
   photocatalysts surfaces. F-P25 photocatalyst also demonstrated to be the
   best material for the treatment of real wastewater coming from
   handicrafts factories.

AB Natural bitumen was implemented as a cheap, green, available and
   efficient sorbent for removal of Pb(II), Cu(II) and Cd(II) ions. The
   effect of important parameters including time, sorbent dosage, pH and
   temperature was explored on adsorption process. Maximum removal for all
   three cations present at pH = 6.0 and 30 min for Pb(II) and Cd(II)
   cations and 60 min for Cu(II) cation. Also, %Removal for all three
   cations was decreased by increasing the temperature which is an
   indication of exothermic adsorption process. However, adsorption
   isotherms for all three cations were interpreted by Langmuir model.
   Also, experimental data of all three cations follows pseudosecond-order
   kinetic model which indicate chemisorption process. Thermodynamic
   parameters including increment G, increment H and increment S were
   calculated for all three cations which present spontaneous nature of
   reaction. Finally, natural bitumen was presented highly
   adsorption-desorption property and used successfully for removal of
   Pb(II), Cu(II) and Cd(II) ions in wastewater real sample. Natural
   bitumen contains mostly carbon and oxygen elements and its good
   performance as a sorbent probably is due to its similar composition with
   other carbonaceous sorbents such as activated carbon.

AB An effective and selective catalytic system based on cerium
   oxide-stannous oxide (CeO2-SnO) wrapped Naalginate hydrogel was
   developed for the selective reduction of potassium ferricyanide
   (K-3[Fe(CN)(6)]). Naalginate hydrogel was used as a reacting container
   for CeO2-SnO nanoparticles. Na-alginate wrapped CeO2- SnO (Alg/CeO2-SnO)
   was applied as a catalyst and examined toward the reduction of several
   hazardous pollutants, such as nitrophenols, dyes and K-3[Fe(CN)(6)].
   Alg/CeO2-SnO nanocatalyst was mostly selective toward K-3[Fe(CN)(6)]
   since it was more effective and economical for reduction of
   K-3[Fe(CN)(6)]. Further different parameters like catalyst amount,
   reducing agent amount, K-3[Fe(CN)(6)] concentration and recyclability
   were optimized. The increase in both nanocatalyst amount and NaBH4
   concentration resulted in increasing the rate of the catalytic reduction
   of K-3[Fe(CN)(6)]. Alg/CeO2-SnO nanocatalyst reduced K-3[Fe(CN)(6)] in
   4.0 min with a reaction rate constant of 0.9114 min(-1). The
   nanocatalyst can be easily recovered by pulling the hydrogel from the
   reaction medium up to four cycles. Alg/CeO2-SnO nanocatalyst was also
   examined in real samples like irrigation water, sea water, well water,
   university water, which was effective for K-3[Fe(CN)(6)] reduction by
   95.16%- 96.54%. This novel approach provides a new catalyst for
   efficient removal of K-3[Fe(CN)(6)] from real samples and can be a time
   and cost alternative tool for environmental safety.

   (CSF), 1.0 wt% of graphene oxide (GO), and 0.4 wt% of a humic acid-like
   (HAL) crosslinker, was deposited over a commercial flat-sheet
   polyethersulfone support with good reproducibility by a simple 1-step
   coating procedure. The synergistic coupling of CSF and the crosslinked
   GO resulted in an improved catalytic activity for bisphenol A (BPA)
   abatement as a model pollutant. The thermocatalytic CSF/GO/HAL (GOT)
   membrane was tested in a nanofiltration crossflow apparatus with a model
   BPA solution and with a real urban wastewater treatment plant effluent.
   Its performances were compared with those of a HAL crosslinked GO
   (GOHAL) reference membrane. The GOT membrane presented high rejection
   towards BPA, antifouling properties, and stability under the filtration
   conditions. Moreover, when compared to the GOHAL reference, the
   thermocatalytic GOT membrane was able to reduce the concentration of BPA
   and the total organic carbon in the feed during filtration. Hence, the
   GOT membrane appears to have high potential in water treatment due to
   its multifunctional characteristics, which include molecular sieving,
   thermocatalytic oxidation of organic pollutants, and self-cleaning
   properties. Additionally, the membrane material showed no significant
   toxicity to the aquatic model organisms Raphidocelis subcapitata,
   Aliivibrio fischeri, and Daphnia magna at concentrations below 50 ppm.

AB Three carbon materials from a varied origin, composition and porosity
   have been used as cost-effective cathodes in different electrochemical
   advanced oxidation processes (i.e. anodic oxidation (AO) and
   electro-Fenton (EF) in homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis
   modalities) for the degradation of an antibiotic (e.g., metronidazole).
   In general, the efficiency towards the pollutant degradation increased
   as: AO < homogeneous EF < heterogeneous EF. The heterogeneous EF
   approach with iron pre-loaded in the carbon cathode outperformed the
   homogenous EF counterpart, despite a lower amount of iron. Reusability
   tests showed that iron-containing cathodes prepared from samples CQ
   (carbon obtained upon steam activation) and CB (carbon prepared by H3PO4
   activation of biomass) were stable over at least three consecutive
   cycles. The best results were attained for cathode prepared with carbon
   CQ modified with iron, yielding over 97% removal of metronidazole after
   150 min in all three reuses. Such better performance is related to the
   favorable adsorption of the pollutant on carbon CQ, thereby favoring the
   close contact between the generated oxidant species and the target
   antibiotic. The cathode based on carbon CQ was tested for the
   degradation of another recalcitrant antibiotic (sulfamethoxazole) in a
   real wastewater treatment plant effluent by means of a heterogeneous EF
   treatment, showing good degradation performance.

AB Novel iron-copper-carbon (FeCuC) aerogel was fabricated through a
   one-step process from metal-resin precursors and then activated with CO2
   and N-2 in environmentally friendly way. The activated FeCuC aerogel was
   applied in a heterogeneous electro-Fenton (EF) process and exhibited
   higher mineralization efficiency than homogeneous EF technology: High
   total organic carbon (TOC) removal of organic pollutants with activated
   FeCuC aerogel was achieved at a wide range of pH values (3-9). The
   chemical oxygen demand (COD) of real dyeing wastewater was below China's
   discharge standard after 30 min of treatment, and the specific energy
   consumption was low (9.2 kW.h.kg(-1)COD(-1)), corresponding to a power
   consumption of only similar to 0.34 kW.h per too of wastewater. The
   enhanced mineralization efficiency of FeCuC aerogel was mostly
   attributable to ultradispersed metallic Fe-Cu nanoparticles embedded in
   3D carbon matrix and the CO2-N-2 treatment. The CO2 activation enhanced
   the accessibility of the aerogel's pores) and the secondary N-2
   activation enlarged the porosity and regenerated the ultradispersed
   zerovalent iron (Fe-0) with reductive carbon. Cu-0 acted as a reduction
   promoter for interfacial electron transfer. Moreover, activated FeCuC
   aerogel presented low iron leaching (<0.1 ppm) in acidic solution and
   can be molded into, different sizes' with high flexibility. Thus, this
   material could be used as a low-cost cathode and efficient heterogeneous

AB Lipopolysaccharides (LPS), also known as endotoxins, can be released
   into the environment when the bacteria's cell wall breaks apart, which
   induces inflammatory responses in humans at amounts of 1-10 ng kg(-1).
   This paper reports on the development and optimization of a novel
   analytical method for the analysis of LPS based on the coupled use of a
   laboratory-made microscale solid-phase extraction (OPE) device for the
   purification and enrichment of LPS before fluorescent dye derivatization
   and lastly capillary electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence
   (CE-LIF) for separation and detection. In this work, the limits of
   detection and quantification of Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP)-LPS were
   found to reach 1.32 ng mL(-1) and 4.39 ng mL(-1), respectively with a
   linear dynamic range of 0.125-0.625 mg L-1 and a relative standard
   deviation of 0.9% in migration time. Scanning electron microscopy
   analysis clearly supports the successful entrapment of KP-LPS within the
   sorbent before elution. In contrast to other LPS extraction methods, the
   optimized mu SPE-based method coupled with CE-LIF provides the following
   advantages: small sample amount for sensitive and selective detection in
   CE-LIF (OPE preconcentration factor of 23 times), reduced volumes of
   organic solvents used (175-225 mu L), high recovery rate of 98%, as well
   as portability for on-site extraction and quantification of analytes.
   The method was successfully applied in the analysis of three types of
   real water samples (i.e. deionized water, secondary effluent and raw
   sewage). Raw sewage was found to contain the highest KP-LPS amount of
   12.5 ng mL(-1) followed by secondary effluent of 7.3 ng mL(-)(1).

AB Photocatalytic membrane reactors (PMRs) are a promising technology for
   wastewater reclamation. The principles of PMRs are based on
   photocatalytic degradation and membrane rejection, the different
   processes occurring simultaneously. Coupled photocatalysis and membrane
   filtration has made PMRs suitable for application in the removal of
   emerging contaminants (ECs), such as diclofenac, carbamazepine,
   ibuprofen, lincomycin, diphenhydramine, rhodamine, and tamoxifen, from
   wastewater, while reducing the likelihood of byproducts being present in
   the permeate stream. The viability of PMRs depends on the hypotheses
   used during design and the kinetic properties of the systems. The choice
   of design models and the assumptions made in their application can have
   an impact on reactor design outcomes. A design's resilience is due to
   the development of a mathematical model that links material and mass
   balances to various sub-models, including the fluid dynamic model, the
   radiation emission model, the radiation absorption model, and the
   kinetic model. Hence, this review addresses the discrepancies with
   traditional kinetic models, fluid flow dynamics, and radiation emission
   and absorption, all of which have an impact on upscaling and reactor
   design. Computational and analytical descriptions of how to develop a
   PMR system with high throughput, performance, and energy efficiency are
   provided. The potential solutions are classified according to the
   catalyst, fluid dynamics, thickness, geometry, and light source used.
   Two main PMR types are comprehensively described, and a discussion of
   various influential factors relating to PMRs was used as a premise for
   developing an ideal reactor. The aim of this work was to resolve
   potential divergences that occur during PMRs design as most real
   reactors do not conform to the idealized fluid dynamics. Lastly, the
   application of PMRs is evaluated, not only in relation to the removal of
   endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) from wastewater, but also in dye,
   oil, heavy metals, and pesticide removal.

AB Wastewaters containing recalcitrant and toxic organic pollutants are
   scarcely decontaminated in conventional wastewater facilities. Then,
   there is an urgent challenge the development of powerful oxidation
   processes to ensure their organic removal in order to preserve the water
   quality in the environment. This review presents the recent development
   of an electrochemical advanced oxidation process (EAOP) like the
   photoelectro-Fenton (PEF) process, covering the period 2010-2019, as an
   effective treatment for wastewater remediation. The high oxidation
   ability of this photo-assisted Fenton-based EAOP is due to the
   combination of in situ generated hydroxyl radicals and the photolytic
   action of UV or sunlight irradiation over the treated wastewater.
   Firstly, the fundamentals and characteristics of the PEF process are
   described to understand the role of oxidizing agents. Further, the
   properties of the homogeneous PEF process with iron catalyst and UV
   irradiation and the benefit of sunlight in the homogeneous solar PEF one
   (SPEF) are discussed, supported with examples over their application to
   the degradation and mineralization of synthetic solutions of industrial
   chemicals, herbicides, dyes and pharmaceuticals, as well as real
   wastewaters. Novel heterogeneous PEF processes involving solid iron
   catalysts or iron-modified cathodes are subsequently detailed. Finally,
   the oxidation power of hybrid processes including photocatalysis/PEF,
   solar photocatalysis/SPEF, photoelectrocatalysis/PEF and solar
   photoelectrocatalysis/SPEF, followed by that of sequential processes
   like electrocoagulation/PEF and biological oxidation coupled to SPEF,
   are analyzed. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work assesses the effectiveness of an artificial intelligence (AI)
   model based on an artificial neural networks (ANN) - genetic algorithm
   (GA) in the prediction of the behavior and optimization of the treatment
   of sulfate wastewaters with Bromophenol blue dye using an
   electro-oxidation (EO) process. Trials were made with a filter
   press-type reactor with a boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode. The ANN model
   was trained with 51 electrolytic experiments by using the electrolysis
   time, flow, current density, pH and dye concentration as input variables
   and the discoloration efficiency as the output one. The performance of
   ANN was measured with RMSE and MAPE values of 10.73 % and 8.81 %,
   respectively, calculated from real and predicted values. Optimum
   conditions determined by GA were reached for the inputs of 10 min, 11.9
   L min(-1), 31.25 mA cm(-2), 2.8 and 41.25 mgL(-1), giving a
   discoloration efficiency of 88.8 0.3 %, close to 95.5 % predicted by the
   model. To validate the AI model, the same experimental conditions were
   applied to treat wastewaters with Bromothymol blue and Thymol blue, with
   analogous structures to Bromophenol blue, and a mixture of the three
   dyes by EO. In all cases, the loss of color decayed following a
   pseudo-first-order kinetics, with similar apparent rate constants. For
   the dye mixture, 69 % COD was reduced at 60 min, with 13 % average
   current efficiency and 0.26 kW h (g COD)(-1) energy consumption. The AI
   model is a strong tool to design, control and operate the EO process
   with a BDD anode to treat wastewaters with similar dyes. (C) 2020

AB The agricultural waste of orange peels (OPs) was utilized as a cheap
   biosorbent and then tested for its ability to treat the reactive red
   (RR) dye wastewater. Several experiments were done to get the
   equilibrium isotherm and kinetic-relevant data. In addition, several
   experimental factors such as solution pH, temperature, contact time, and
   initial RR dye concentration were studied, in light of their impact on
   the biosorption process. The utilized isotherm and kinetic models were
   evaluated by using the chi-square test and coefficient of determination
   parameters for their representation of real data. In addition, the
   obtained data of their biosorption capacities, at different conditions,
   were modeled by the artificial neural network (ANN) approach. The
   results of the isotherm study revealed that the experimental data can be
   best accounted by both the Langmuir and Temkin models, demonstrating
   that the RR molecules were sorbed to two or more different types of
   biosorption sites of OP. The kinetic study for determining the
   characteristics of the rate of diffusion demonstrated that the
   intraparticle diffusion process was not the sole rate-limiting step in
   the biosorption of the RR dye-OP couple. Furthermore, the biosorption
   process was chemisorption in nature, as the pseudo-second-order reaction
   proved to be the best representative model for the kinetic data. The
   outcome of modeling also assumed that using the ANN tool was useful to
   reproduce the data again and foretell the manner in which biosorption
   behaved. According to the results of the Langmuir model, it was found
   that the maximum OP uptake for the biosorption of the RR dye was up to
   82 mg/g, observed at optimized values of the experimental parameters.
   Such prior results highlight that OP is an effective agent of
   biosorption in the elimination of RR dyes from polluted solutions,
   moreover, in a cost-effective manner.

AB Although electro-Fenton wastewater treatment processes are particularly
   attractive for their high oxidation power, they are seriously limited by
   the low pH values that are required for the process, the subsequent
   neutralization of acid and the addition and removal of iron chemicals.
   In this work, a study on the design, characterization and performance of
   a novel electro-Fenton reactor, shows that there is a simultaneous
   effect that can overcome these limitations when combining activated
   carbon (AC) adsorption and electro-Fenton effects, while working at same
   time under neutral pH conditions. The reactor arrangement proposed,
   involves a cation exchange resin that continuously supplies Fe(II) ions
   to a chamber containing an AC adsorption bed that is positioned between
   two concentric porous carbon electrodes. Preliminary experiments
   assessing the 2e- electrochemical reduction of dissolved oxygen to
   produce H2O2 in the reactor in the absence of AC, showed that while the
   concentrations of electro-generated peroxide are, as expected,
   proportional to the current density, they are inversely related to the
   current efficiency values. A fluorescence study of hydroxyl radical
   ('OH) production on the other hand, showed that in the absence and in
   the presence of iron ions, the corresponding concentration of 'OH is
   0.800 and 1.057 mu M, respectively. Experiments with the reactor using
   varying amounts of AC, resulted not only in coupled adsorption effects
   characterized by a removal capacity that increases with the amount of
   AC, but also in increased electrical conductivity and higher
   electro-Fenton activity that is probably related to an improved
   electrical contact between the AC particles and the polarized
   carbonaceous electrode surface. The performance of the electro-Fenton
   reactor proposed in this work, was finally evaluated in terms of the
   removal of a model pollutant dye in both synthetic and real secondary
   effluents using different AC packed levels. Consistent with previous
   experiments, the fully compacted AC presented the higher removal rates
   due to the simultaneous effect of the adsorption of the pollutant and
   the coupled electro-Fenton degradation process.

AB In this work, the application of an iron electrode-based
   electrocoagulation (EC) process on the treatment of a real textile
   wastewater (RTW) was investigated. In order to perform an efficient
   integration of the EC process with a biological oxidation one, an
   enhancement in the biodegradability and low toxicity of final compounds
   was sought. Optimal values of EC reactor operation parameters (pH,
   current density and electrolysis time) were achieved by applying a full
   factorial 3(3) experimental design. Biodegradability and toxicity assays
   were performed on treated RTW samples obtained at the optimal values of:
   pH of the solution (7.0), current density (142.9 A m(-2)) and different
   electrolysis times. As response variables for the biodegradability and
   toxicity assessment, the Zahn-Wellens test (D-t), the ratio values of
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) relative to low-molecular-weight
   carboxylates anions (LMCA) and lethal concentration 50 (LC50) were used.
   According to the D-t, the DOC/LMCA ratio and LC50, an electrolysis time
   of 15 min along with the optimal values of pH and current density were
   suggested as suitable for a next stage of treatment based on a
   biological oxidation process.

   to investigate the adsorption behavior of the 3D grapheme materials for

   materials exhibited a porous network structure with the pore size
   ranging from 0. 5 to tens of micrometers, and displayed adsorption
   capacity as high as 752 mg.g(-1) for MB. The adsorption behavior
   followed Langmuir adsorption isotherm and pseudo. second. order kinetic
   model, indicating that the adsorption process was mainly a monolayer
   process. The intraparticle diffusion model was also used to investigate
   the diffusion mechanism of the adsorption behavior. The initial
   adsorption stage resulted from the external surface diffusion, and the
   later stage represented a gradual intraparticle diffusion. The 3D
   graphene materials offered excellent reproducible ability, as the
   removal efficiency decreased only by about 20.9% after 5 cycles of

   exhibited good practical application ability with MB removal efficiency

AB The present study investigates the synergistic performance of the

   decolorization of acid blue 113 (AB113) dye from aqueous solution and
   its feasibility for the treatment of real textile wastewater.
   Decolorization of AB113 solution was modeled by central composite
   design-response surface methodology (CCD-RSM) and artificial neural
   network (ANN) approaches and optimized by CCD-RSM and genetic algorithm
   (GA) approaches. Statistical metrics indicated that both CCD-RSM and ANN
   approaches seemed satisfactory. However, the results of statistical fit
   measures indicated a relative superiority of CCD-RSM as compared to the
   ANN approach. The results of optimization of the process parameters by
   CCD-RSM and GA approaches appeared to be similar as follows: pH = 6.1,
   reaction time = 25 min, US power density = 300 W/L, ZnO = 0.88 g/L and
   PS = 2.43 mmol/L. The synergistic effect of the hybrid US/UV/ZnO/PS
   process in comparison with its individual processes (US, UV, ZnO, and
   PS) was found to be 54.3%. Quenching experiments discovered that SO4
   center dot- and HO center dot are the main oxidizing radicals in a
   mildly acidic condition of the reaction solution. The removal efficiency
   of AB113 in the presence of some anions decreased in the order of
   bicarbonate > sulfate > phosphate > nitrate > chloride. Further, the
   reusability feasibility of ZnO showed that the ZnO material retained its
   photocatalytic property after five successive cycles of reusability
   test, while Zn2+ ion concentration in the reaction solution was measured
   to be 2.81 mg/L. The findings also indicated that the integrated process
   application suppresses extremely chemical and electrical costs. The
   study of the feasibility of the US/UV/ZnO/PS process in the treatment of
   real textile wastewater was done by determining COD, TOC and BOD5/COD
   ratio. Results demonstrated that the 96.6 and 97.1% reduction of COD and
   TOC was achieved after 5 and 7 h reaction time, respectively. The
   obtained BOD5/COD ratio changed from about 0.15 (for non-treated
   wastewater) to about 0.61 with increasing reaction time from zero to 90
   min. In conclusion, the hybrid US/UV/ZnO/PS system can be proposed as a
   novel and promising approach to be utilized as a pretreatment technique
   before a biological treatment process to facilitate the biological
   treatment of recalcitrant textile wastewater.

AB Aims: The main aim of the study was to examine the feasibility and
   benefits of adsorption onto multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)
   coupled with cloud point extraction (CPE) for the removal of Rhodamine B
   (RB) from aqueous solutions.
   Background: MWCNTs offer the particular features of the ideal adsorbents
   for the organic dyes such as hollow tubular structure and specific
   surface area. Nevertheless, they suffer from the drawbacks of low
   dispersion in the aqueous solutions and separation inconvenience from
   the media. Cloud point extraction, combined with the adsorption onto
   MWCNTs can be a promising method to overcome the problems.
   Objective: In the study, adsorption onto MWCNTs coupled with CPE was
   applied for RB removal from aqueous solutions. The process was optimized
   by the response surface modeling method. Moreover, the applicability of
   the proposed method in the real sample analyses was investigated.
   Methods: MWCNTs were used as adsorbent and Triton X-100 (TX-100) as the
   nonionic surfactant for CPE process. The experiments were carried out
   based on a Box-Behnken design (BBD) with the input variables of MWCNTs
   dosage (0.6-1.2 mg), solution pH (3-9), clouding time (20-40 min) and
   TX-100 concentration (10-20 v/v%) using 5 mg L-1 RB solutions.
   Result: Regression analyses resulted in a statistically significant
   quadratic model (R-2-0.9718, F=24.96, p<0.0001) by which the optimum
   levels of the variables were predicted as: MWCNTs dosage of 0.7 mg,
   pH-3, clouding time of 39.9 minutes and TX-100 concentration of 19.91%
   (v/v). The predicted conditions were experimentally validated by
   achieving an RB removal of 94.24%.
   Conclusion: Based on the results, the combination of the environmentally
   friendly technique of CPE with adsorption onto MWCNTs allows the
   efficient removal of RB from water samples and the method can be
   effectively optimized by the response surface modeling.

AB Aniline, antimony (Sb) and chromium (Cr) are typical and regulated
   co-contaminants in textile wastewater, but their removal was often
   investigated individually. In this work, simultaneous removal of
   aniline, Sb and Cr by ZVI coupled with H2O2 was studied. With the dosage
   of 0.5 g L-1 ZVI and 2 mM H2O2, aniline, Sb and Cr can be removed
   completely at pH 3. Experiment with iso-propanol as the radical
   scavenger confirmed that (OH)-O-center dot derived from Fenton reaction
   accounts for aniline degradation, but not for Sb and Cr removal. H2O2
   accelerated Fe(0) corrosion and generated the nanoscale
   iron(hydro)oxides. Aniline was degraded by (OH)-O-center dot first and
   then the degradation products were removed by iron(hydro)oxides via
   adsorption and co-precipitation. Both Fe(0) and iron (hydro)oxides were
   responsible for Sb and Cr removal, yet iron(hydro)oxides were identified
   as the major contributor. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis
   demonstrated that Sb and Cr were removed mainly as the states of Sb(III)
   and Cr(III). The real textile wastewater investigation confirmed that
   ZVI coupled with H2O2 can eliminate aniline, Sb and Cr effectively,
   which has important implications for the advanced treatment of textile
   wastewater.

AB The progress in industrialization everyday life has led to the
   continuous entry of several anthropogenic compounds, including dyes,
   into surrounding ecosystem causing arduous concerns for human health and
   biosphere. Therefore, microbial degradation of dyes is considered an
   eco-efficient and cost-competitive alternative to physicochemical
   approaches. These degradative biosystems mainly depend on the
   utilization of nutritive co-substrates such as yeast extract peptone in
   conjunction with glucose. Herein, a synergestic interaction between
   strains of mixed-culture consortium consisting of Rhodotorula sp.,
   Raoultella planticola; and Staphylococcus xylosus was recruited in
   methylene blue (MB) degradation using agro-industrial waste as an
   economic and nutritive co-substrate. Via statistical means such as
   Plackett-Burman design and central composite design, the impact of
   significant nutritional parameters on MB degradation was screened and
   optimized. Predictive modeling denoted that complete degradation of MB
   was achieved within 72 h at MB (200 mg/L), NaNO3 (0.525 gm/L)(,)
   molasses (385 mu L/L), pH (7.5) and inoculum size (18%). Assessment of
   degradative enzymes revealed that intracellular NADH-reductase and
   DCIP-reductase were key enzymes controlling degradation process by
   104.52 +/- 1.75 and 274.04 +/- 3.37 IU/min/mg protein after 72 h of
   incubation. In addition, azoreductase, tyrosinase, laccase, nitrate
   reductase, MnP and LiP also contributed significantly to MB degradation
   process. Physicochemical monitoring analysis, namely UV-Visible
   spectrophotometry and FTIR of MB before treatment and degradation
   byproducts indicated deterioration of azo bond and demethylation.
   Moreover, the non-toxic nature of degradation byproducts was confirmed
   by phytotoxicity and cytotoxicity assays. Chlorella vulgaris retained
   its photosynthetic capability (> 85%) as estimated from Chlorophyll-a/b
   contents compared to > 30% of MB-solution. However, the viability of
   Wi-38 and Vero cells was estimated to be 90.67% and 99.67%,
   respectively, upon exposure to MB-metabolites. Furthermore, an eminent
   employment of consortium either freely-suspended or immobilized in plain
   distilled water and optimized slurry in a bioaugmentation process was
   implemented to treat MB in artificially-contaminated municipal
   wastewater and industrial effluent. The results showed a corporative
   interaction between the consortium examined and co-existing microbiota;
   reflecting its compatibility and adaptability with different microbial
   niches in different effluents with various physicochemical contents.

AB The present study is a "first-of-its-kind" work on an integrated process
   consisting of a hydrodynamic cavitation (HC)-assisted advanced oxidation
   process and vacuum membrane distillation (VMD) for the degradation of
   Methylene Blue (MB) from aqueous solution as well as recovery of the
   water post-treatment. Experiments using HC were carried out in a
   systematic approach by optimizing the geometry of the cavitating device
   followed by studying the effect of operating parameters such as pH and
   inlet pressure on the degradation rate of MB. Under optimized conditions
   of pH 2 and 5 bar of inlet pressure, degradation of MB was found to be
   23.48% in 120 min by the HC process alone with a rate constant of 2.4 x
   10(-3) min(-1). Coupling HC with H2O2 and O-3 further enhanced the
   process, and the degradation obtained was 93.07 and 46.60%, respectively
   in 60 min. Moreover, a kinetic model was proposed for degradation of MB
   using HC coupled with oxidizing agents. Furthermore, mineralization
   studies were also conducted by evaluating the total organic carbon (TOC)
   content, and the possible intermediates involved during the process were
   evaluated using ex situ mass spectroscopic studies. The water from the
   exit of the cavitating setup was further processed through VMD to
   achieve zero liquid discharge. The optimized flow rate, permeate
   pressure, and temperature for the VMD process were 10 L/h, 20 mmHg, and
   50 degrees C, respectively, and a water recovery of around 8% was
   achieved. Technoeconomic feasibility studies with real-life textile
   effluent revealed that the combined approach of HC-based advanced
   oxidation processes and VMD resulted in a chemical oxygen demand and TOC
   removal of 35.41% and 39.57%, respectively, simultaneously recovering
   water of similar to 90% at the economics of $18.61/m(3).

AB Hierarchical NiO hollow microspheres with five different sizes have been
   synthesized by a simple refluxing method. The sizes of the hierarchical
   NiO hollow microspheres can be facilely tuned by altering the sizes of
   functionalized polystyrene particles (PS) templates. Firstly, Ni(OH)(2)
   nanoflakelets assembled onto the surface of the functionalized PS to
   form core/shell structures. Secondly, Ni(OH)(2) hollow shells were
   obtained after removal of the core by dissolving PS latex in toluene.
   Finally, through the calcinations of the Ni(OH)(2) hollow shells,
   hierarchical NiO hollow microspheres with the diameters of 237, 308,
   712. 892 and 1157 nm were obtained, respectively. Adsorption of Congo
   red (CR) onto the as-prepared five samples from aqueous solution was
   investigated. The results showed that the as-prepared NiO hollow
   microspheres were effective adsorbents for the removal of CR pollutant
   from waste water as a result of their unique hierarchical structures and
   high specific surface areas. Moreover, the adsorption capacities for CR
   are different due to the different sizes of NiO hollow microspheres. It
   was observed that the adsorption capacity increased with the decrease of
   the size of hollow microspheres. Especially, the smallest hierarchical
   NiO hollow microspheres have the highest adsorption capacity, which
   could achieve 526.3 mg/g at room temperature (pH 7.0). Most importantly,
   the adsorbent can be easily renewed, which will be a great potential
   material in real applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB The application of waste-derived iron for reuse in wastewater treatment
   is an effective way of utilizing waste and attaining sustainability in
   the overall process. In the present investigation, bio-electro-Fenton
   process was initiated for the cathodic degradation of surfactants using
   waste-iron catalyzed MFC (WFe-MFC). The waste-iron was derived from
   spent tonner ink using calcination at 600 degrees C. Three surfactants
   namely, sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide,
   and Triton x-100 were selected as target pollutants. The effect of
   experimental factors like application of catalyst, contact time,
   external resistance, and anodic substrate con-centration on the SDS
   degradation was investigated. At a neutral pH, the cathodic surfactants
   removal efficiency in WFe-MFC was above 85% in a contact time of 180 min
   with the initial surfactant concentration of similar to 20 mg L-1 and
   external resistance of 100 Omega. The long-term operation using
   secondary treated real wastewater with un-changed cathode proved that
   the catalyst was still active to produce effluent SDS concentration of
   less than 1 mg L-1 in 4 h of contact time after 16 cycles. In a way, the
   present investigation suggests a potential application for spent tonner
   ink in the form of Fenton catalyst for wastewater treatment via
   bio-electro-Fenton MFC.

AB In this study, an innovative electrospun photocatalyst self-cleaning
   BiOBr/Ag membrane is introduced for the MD treatment of dyeing
   wastewater coupled with post-MD UV and visible light exposure for fouled
   membrane regeneration. The E-BiOBr/Ag membrane was fabricated by
   successfully coating an electrospun membrane with BiOBr/Ag catalyst
   particles using electrospray technology, with the goal to achieve higher
   hydrophobicity and the reproducible property. Along with the E-BiOBr/Ag
   membrane, two commercial polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) and
   polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membranes were tested for comparison. The
   fouling processes on all three membranes were monitored in real-time
   using optical coherence tomography (OCT). The coating of BiOBr/Ag
   particles on the E-BiOBr/Ag membrane's surface accelerated dye foulant
   degradation through the electronholes' strong oxidization capacity when
   exposed to UV. Meanwhile, after Ag nanoparticles were coated on the
   BiOBr photocatalyst by UV deposition method, not only improved the
   efficiency of electron separation and transfer but also lessened the
   electron recombination phenomenon effectively. Correspondingly, compared
   to the two commercial membranes, the BiOBr/Ag photocatalyst membrane
   achieved significant improvements in the recovery efficiencies of the
   water contact angle (95.6%) and water flux (92.2%) under UV
   illumination, pointing to its potential for fouled membrane
   regeneration. In addition, the deposition of Ag on BiOBr as cocatalyst
   enhanced the visible light harvesting. Finally, the BiOBr/Ag
   photocatalyst membrane maintained good flux recovery and dye rejection
   (99.9%) over a 5-cycle MD test coupled with visible light exposure,
   suggesting the application of the novel self-cleaning photocatalyst
   membrane as a potential alternative for upscaling MD technology to the
   industrial level.

AB Nowadays there is a continuously increasing worldwide concern for
   development of alternative water reuse technologies, mainly focused on
   agriculture and industry. In this context, Advanced Oxidation Processes
   (AOPs) are considered a highly competitive water treatment technology
   for the removal of those organic pollutants not treatable by
   conventional techniques due to their high chemical stability and/or low
   biodegradability. Although chemical oxidation for complete
   mineralization is usually expensive, its combination with a biological
   treatment is widely reported to reduce operating costs. This paper
   reviews recent research combining AOPs (as a pre-treatment or
   post-treatment stage) and bioremediation technologies for the
   decontamination of a wide range of synthetic and real industrial
   wastewater. Special emphasis is also placed on recent studies and
   large-scale combination schemes developed in Mediterranean countries for
   non-biodegradable wastewater treatment and reuse. The main conclusions
   arrived at from the overall assessment of the literature are that more
   work needs to be done on degradation kinetics and reactor modeling of
   the combined process, and also dynamics of the initial attack on primary
   contaminants and intermediate species generation. Furthermore, better
   economic models must be developed to estimate how the cost of this
   combined process varies with specific industrial wastewater
   characteristics, the overall decontamination efficiency and the relative
   cost of the AOP versus biological treatment. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

AB The oxidation of hypophosphite and phosphite in an aqueous solution by
   an ultraviolet (UV)/H2O2 process was studied in this work. The reactions
   were performed in a lab-scale batch photoreactor. The effect of
   different parameters such as H2O2 dosage, H2O2 feeding mode and the
   initial pH of the solution on the oxidation efficiency of the process
   was investigated. The results indicated that the UV/H2O2 process could
   effectively oxidize hypophosphite and phosphite in both synthesized and
   real wastewater. However, neither H2O2 nor UV alone was able to
   appreciably oxidize the hypophosphite or phosphite. The best way of
   feeding H2O2 was found to be 'continuous feeding', which maximized the
   reaction rate. It was also found that the process presented a wide range
   of applicable initial pH (5-11). When treating real rinse-wastewater,
   which was obtained from the electroless nickel plating industry, both
   hypophosphite and phosphite were completely oxidized within 60 min, and
   by extending by another 30 min, over 90% of the chemical oxygen demand
   removal was obtained. Without any additional catalyst, the UV/H2O2
   process can oxidize hypophosphite and phosphite to easily removable
   phosphate. It is really a powerful and environmentally friendly
   treatment method for the wastewater containing hypophosphite and
   phosphite.

AB Biocatalytic degradation of recalcitrant pollutants employing
   ligninolytic enzymes is a promising approach for wastewater treatment.
   However, enzymes production must be improved to make biodegradation a
   more costeffective treatment. In this research, laccase production from
   Trametes versicolor using lignocellulosic residues (agave bagasse,
   coconut fibers and wheat bran) as cosubstrates was improved using a
   central composite facecentered design, and the application of the
   enzymes-rich culture supernatant was evaluated for blue wastewater
   biodegradation. Findings revealed that the optimal conditions for
   laccase production were found at 35 degrees C and 5 g/L of wheat bran as
   cosubstrate, reaching about 200 U/mL in 11 days in a batch submerged
   fermentation. These conditions were scaled up for a submerged
   fermentation using an airlift reactor, and a maximum enzymatic activity
   of 1200 U/mL was achieved in 9 days at 30 degrees C. This enzymes-rich
   culture supernatant was tested for the degradation of blue wastewater
   from aircraft in an airlift reactor. Results showed a COD removal
   efficiency of 43% and an increase of the biodegradability index from
   0.64 to 1.36, both results applying an enzymatic activity of supernatant
   of 300 U/mL. In conclusion, the enzymatic biodegradation becomes a

AB The present work attempt to demonstrate a sustainable wastewater
   treatment process which is cost-effective, durable and employs
   light-weight functional material. Specifically, the study reveals the
   preparation of photocatalyst (Mg@TiO2) decorated on natural floatable
   spheres for photo-oxidation of organic pollutants under sunlight
   irradiation. About 10-15 mm diameter spheres were prepared mainly using
   clay and activated carbon. Mg@TiO2 photocatalytic particles were
   decorated on the surface of clay spheres and sintered at 550 degrees C
   temperature. The as-prepared photocatalyst decorated spheres were
   characterized by powder XRD, FTIR, SEM-EDX, and BET. The
   characterization results indicated well crystalline structures, adequate
   porosity and enough surface area, high stability and high photocatalytic
   activity which apparently enhanced photocatalysis. Treatment efficiency
   in terms of Chemical oxygen Demand (COD) was evaluated under different
   light sources using real-time industrial wastewater samples. The results
   showed about 80-90% removal of organic pollutants in textile and
   pharmaceutical industrial effluents within 24 h under sunlight. In
   addition, the recovery, recyclability, and reproducibility of the
   proposed photocatalyst were appreciable. The catalyst remained active
   and exhibited fair degradation efficiency up to 10-15 cycles. The
   spherical shape and buoyant nature influenced treatment efficiency by
   continuous spinning that made the illumination of decorated
   photocatalysts to photon and thereby inducing the intimate contact
   between pollutants and catalyst. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB In wastewater treatment, flocculation is a widely used solid/liquid
   separation technique, which typically employs a charged polymer, a
   polyelectrolyte (PEL). Polyelectrolytes features, such as charge type,
   charge density and molecular weight, are essential parameters affecting
   the mechanism of flocculation and subsequent floc sedimentation. The
   effectiveness of the process is also influenced by the characteristics
   of the system (e.g., type, size, and available surface area of suspended
   particles, pH of the medium, charge of suspended particles). Thus, a
   good understanding of the flocculation kinetics, involved mechanisms and
   flocs structure is essential in identifying the most adequate treatment
   conditions, having also into consideration possible subsequent
   treatments. In this study, Eucalyptus bleached pulp and a cellulosic
   pulp with high lignin content (~4.5 wt%) obtained from Eucalyptus wood
   waste were used for bio-PELs production. Firstly, a pre-treatment with
   sodium periodate increased the pulps reactivity. To produce cationic
   cellulose the oxidation step was followed by the introduction of
   cationic groups in the cellulose chains, through reaction with Girard's
   reagent T. Applying different molar ratios (p less than 0.975 and 3.9)
   of Girard's reagent T to aldehyde groups led to cationic PELs with
   diverse charge density. On the other hand, to obtain anionic cellulose a
   sulfonation reaction with sodium metabisulfite was applied to the
   intermediate dialdehyde cellulose-based products, during 24 or 72 h, and
   anionic-PELs with diverse features were obtained. The developed water
   soluble, anionic and cationic bio-PELs were characterized and tested as
   flocculation agents for a textile industry effluent treatment.
   Initially, jar-tests were used to tune the most effective flocculation
   procedure (pH, flocculant dosage, etc.). Flocculation using these
   conditions was then monitored continuously, over time, using laser
   diffraction spectroscopy (LDS). Due to the small size of the dyes
   molecules, a dual system with an inorganic complexation agent
   (bentonite) was essential for effective decolouration of the effluent.
   Performance in the treatment was monitored first by turbidity removal
   evaluation (75-88% with cationic-PELs, 75-81% with anionic-PELs) and COD
   reduction evaluation (79-81% with cationic-PELs, 63-77% with
   anionic-PELs) in the jar tests. Additionally, the evolution of flocs
   characteristics (structure and size) during their growth and the
   flocculation kinetics, were studied using the LDS technique, applying
   the different PELs produced and for a range of PEL concentration. The
   results obtained through this monitoring procedure allowed to discuss
   the possible flocculation mechanisms involved in the process. The
   results obtained with the bio-PELs were compared with those obtained
   using synthetic PELs, commonly applied in effluents treatment,
   polyacrylamides. The developed bio-PELs can be competitive, eco-friendly
   flocculation agents for effluents treatment from several industries,
   when compared to traditional synthetic flocculants with a significant
   environmental footprint. Moreover, LDS proved to be a feasible technique
   to monitor flocculation processes, even when a real industrial effluent
   is being tested. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

AB ABSTRACT  Introduction. Colored wastewater is a complex mixture
   containing recalcitrant substances that are difficult to oxidize by
   conventional methods. Photocatalysis with suspended TiO2 has been shown
   to be efficient in the oxidation of substances by photoactivation of
   catalyst with artificial light.The use of sunlight in the process
   reduces operation costs in a full scale application of this wastewater. 
   Objective. Evaluate the treatment of a mixture of azoic dyes by
   photocatalysis with TiO2 suspensions using solar and artificial light. 
   Materials and methods. An annular reactor with artificial light was
   tested, and an experimental design was applied to evaluate the effect of
   dyes, TiO2 and H2O2 concentrations. Under such favorable conditions, the
   dyes mixture was degraded using natural solar light and a batch reactor.
   Results. The artificial light system showed that dyes and TiO2
   concentrations were the factors that significantly influenced on color
   and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removals. Favorable operational
   conditions and model equations for color and COD diminutions were
   established from the experimental design. The system with sunlight
   removed 100% of color and 80% of COD after 3h of treatment. UV-vis
   spectrum of dyes mixture was studied during the process and this showed
   possible formation of carboxylic acids and subsequent mineralization. 
   Conclusion. Photocatalysis with TiO2 and sunlight showed the degradative
   capacity of the photocatalytic process for remediation of waters charged
   with mixtures of azoic dyes.

AB Several efforts have been carried out to present an efficient method for
   PMS activation. This work presented the use of UVC-LEDs (light emitting
   diodes) and US (ultrasound) to activate PMS for decolorization of Direct
   Orange 26 (DO26). The performance of UVC-LEDs/US/PMS process was
   effective in a broad range of pH (3.0-9.0). Complete decolorization was
   obtained in only 12 min in pH = 7.0 and 1.5 mM PMS. Bicarbonate and
   nitrite ions showed inhibitory effect on decolorization while sulfate,
   chloride, and nitrate had no significant effect on the performance of
   the process. Transition metals in homogenous (Fe2+ and Co2+) and
   heterogeneous forms (Fe3O4 and Co3O4) accelerated decolorization in
   UVC-LEDs/US/PMS system. The presence of turbidity declined the
   performance of UVC-LEDs/US/PMS through the prevention of PMS activation
   by UV and US. Compared to other oxidants (S2O8 (2-), H2O2 and
   2Na(2)CO(3).3H(2)O(2)), PMS proved the higher function in decolorization
   of DO26 in UVC-LEDs/US/oxidant system. Scavenging experiments showed
   that O-1(2), HOaEuro cent, and SO4 (aEuro cent-) contributed in the
   degradation of DO26. Moreover, the UVC-LEDs/US/PMS system could markedly
   increase the biodegradability of real textile wastewater. These results
   promised an effective process for degradation of organic pollutants from
   aquatic environment.

AB A novel antifouling coating based on the polymerization of a
   polymerisable bicontinuous microemulsion (PBM) was developed and applied
   for commercially available membranes for textile wastewater treatment.
   PBM coating was produced by polymerizing, on a polyethersulfone (PES)
   membrane, a bicontinuous microemulsion, realized by finely tuning its
   properties in terms of chemical composition and polymerization
   temperature. In particular, the PBM was prepared by using, as the
   surfactant component, inexpensive and commercially available
   dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB). The coating exhibited a more
   hydrophilic and a smoother surface in comparison to uncoated PES
   surface, making the produced PBM membranes more resistant and less prone
   to be affected by fouling. The antifouling potential of PBM membranes
   was assessed by using humic acid (HA) as a model foulant, evaluating the
   water permeability decrease as an indicator of the fouling propensity of
   the membranes. PBM membrane performances in terms of dye rejection, when
   applied for model textile wastewater treatment, were also evaluated and
   compared to PES commercial ones. The PBM membranes were finally
   successfully scaled-up (total membrane area 0.33 m(2)) and applied in a
   pilot membrane bioreactor (MBR) unit for the treatment of real textile
   wastewater. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The discharge of untreated tannery industrial wastewater into the
   environment has resulted in an adverse effect on the ecosystem and
   public health. Therefore, this work aimed to remove chromium ions from
   tannery wastewater through magnetite graphene oxide-nanocomposite
   (GO-Fe3O4). The experimental design of the study was a full factorial
   2(4) approach using pH, adsorbent dose, contact time, and initial
   chromium concentrations. The results of FTIR analysis revealed the
   presence of functional groups such as hydroxyl (3438 cm(-1)), alcohol
   (1230 cm(-1)), aromatic (1467 cm(-1)), ketone (1629 cm(-1)), and ether
   (1120 cm(-1)). Similarly, GO-Fe3O4 acquired a high surface area of 296.2
   m(2)/g whereas the XRD analysis showed the presence of predominant peaks
   which are attributed to the magnetite component. Moreover, the SEM image
   showed many ups and downs on the surface of the adsorbent. These cracks
   of morphology can create a conducive environment for the interaction of
   adsorbent and adsorbate. The maximum chromium removal of 95.9% was
   achieved at the optimum conditions of the initial chromium concentration
   of 40 mg/L, pH 4, adsorbent dose 1 g/100 mL, and contact time of 120 min
   whereas the removal of chromium from real tannery wastewater was found
   to be 90.3%. Based on the adsorption isotherm, the Langmuir model was
   the best fit for experimental data at R-2 0.99, indicating homogeneous
   and monolayer adsorption. Finally, it can be concluded that GO-Fe3O4 was
   effective for chromium removal, which is a promising technology to be
   scaled up at the industrial level for wastewater treatment.

AB In this study, the sepiolite-iron oxide-manganese dioxide
   (Sep-Fe3O4-MnO2) nanocomposite was synthesized and applied as a
   magnetically separable adsorbent for removal of Pb(II) ions from water
   in a batch system. The effects of initial Pb(II) concentration,
   adsorbent dosage, contact time, pH value, and temperature were
   investigated to optimize the conditions for maximum adsorption. The
   equilibrium adsorption data were analyzed with the Langmuir, Freundlich,
   and Temkin models. The adsorption process closely agreed with the
   Langmuir adsorption isotherm, and the monolayer saturation adsorption
   value was achieved as 131.58 mg g(-1). The adsorption kinetics follow
   the pseudo-second-order (PSO) model that illustrated the rate
   controlling step might be chemisorption. Thermodynamic investigations
   for the removal process were conducted by determining the values of G
   degrees, H degrees, and S degrees. The adsorption behavior of Pb(II) on
   the Sep-Fe3O4-MnO2 was a spontaneous and endothermic process. Several
   consecutive adsorption-desorption cycles confirmed that the proposed
   Sep-Fe3O4-MnO2 nanocomposite could be reused after successive lead
   removal. Furthermore, the practical application of the adsorbent was
   successfully realized by the treatment of real Pb-contaminated water
   samples.

AB Electrocatalytic treatment of real textile wastewater was investigated
   in continuous electrochemical reactor using dimensionally stable Ti/RuO2
   anode. Effects of various parameters such as: elapsed time, current, pH,
   retention time on the COD removal, color removal and specific energy
   consumed were evaluated. Central Composite Design under RSM was used for
   experimental design, data analysis, optimization, interaction analysis
   between the various electrochemical parameters and steady state time
   analysis. GC MS and UV spectrophotometric analysis of the untreated and
   treated wastewater were conducted to identify the oxidized and
   transformed/degraded compounds during the oxidation process, and a
   suitable degradation mechanism was proposed. Treated wastewater may
   contain toxic chlorinated compounds due to mediated oxidation by various
   hydrolyzed chlorine species. Therefore, disposability of treated
   wastewater was assessed by conducting toxicity bioassay test.
   The optimal set of operating parameters were found to be elapsed time =
   124 min, current = 1.37 A, pH = 5.54 and retention time = 157.6 min to
   simultaneously achieve COD removal, color removal and specific energy
   consumed as 86.22%, 94.74% and 0.012 kW h, respectively. GC-MS analysis
   showed presence of chlorinated compounds in the treated wastewater. The
   toxicity bioassay test resulted acute toxicity with 100% mortality rate
   within one minute and one hour exposure with untreated and treated
   textile wastewater, respectively. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Treatment of a saline petrochemical wastewater with BOD5/COD ratio of
   less than 0.1 was investigated using a consortium consisted of three
   isolated salt-tolerant bacteria namely, Kocuria turfanesis, Halomonas
   alkaliphila and Pseudomonas balearica. Selected bacteria were isolated
   from petrochemical wastewater containing mineral salt mediums of 3%
   salinity. A lab-scale activated sludge bioreactor was used for startup
   in batch mode operation and after obtaining the MLSS concentration of
   about 3000 mg/L, the operation was changed to continuous flow mode to
   determine the biokinetic coefficients under different organic loading
   rates of 0.33-1.21 kg CODm(-3) d(-1). The COD removal efficiency of
   78.7%-61.5% was observed for treatment of real saline wastewater with a
   decreasing trend along with increasing the organic loading rate. In
   addition, results of kinetic investigation demonstrated that the
   yield(Y), endogenous decay coefficient (K-d), maximum reaction rate
   (K-max), maximum specific growth rate (mu(max)) and saturation constant
   (K-s) were 0.54 mg VSS mg COD-1, 0.014 day(-1), 1.23 day(-1), 0.66
   day(-1), and 1315 mg 171, respectively. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB BACKGROUND: TiO2 heterogeneous photocatalysis should be optimized before
   application for the removal of pollutants in treated wastewaters. The
   response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural networks (ANNs)
   were applied to model and optimize the photocatalytic degradation of
   total phenolic (TPh) compounds in real secondary and tertiary treated
   municipal wastewaters. RESULTS: RSM was developed by considering a
   central composite design (CCD) with three input variables, i.e. TiO2
   mass, initial concentration of TPh and irradiation intensity. At the
   same time a feed-forward multilayered perceptron ANN trained using back
   propagation algorithms was used and compared with RSM. Under the optimum
   conditions established in experiments ([TPh]0 = 3 mg L-1; [TiO2] = 300
   mg L-1; I = 600 W m-2) the degradation for both TPh and total organic
   carbon (TOC) followed pseudo-first-order kinetic model. Complete
   degradation of TPh took place in 180 min and reduction of TOC reached
   80%. A significant abatement of the overall toxicity was accomplished as
   revealed by Microtox bioassay. CONCLUSIONS: It was found that the
   variables considered have important effects on TPh removal efficiency.
   The results demonstrated that the use of experimental design strategy is
   indispensable for successful investigation and adequate modeling of the
   process and that ANNs gave better modelling capability than RSM.

AB The presence of emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals in aquatic
   means presents as a serious threat, since their real consequences for
   the environment and human health are not well known. Therefore, this
   work consisted of preparing and characterize sludge-derived activated
   carbons (beverage sludge activated carbon - BSAC and acid-treated
   beverage sludge activated carbon - ABSAC) to investigate their use in
   the pharmaceuticals adsorption in aqueous media. The morphology study
   has demonstrated that ABSAC, unlike BSAC, exhibited an abundant porous
   structure, with smaller particles and bigger roughness. Adsorption
   results indicated that the ABSAC was more effective that BSAC, since it
   presented superior surface area (642 m(2) g(-1)) and total pore volume
   (0.485 cm(3) g(-1)) values. Pseudosecond-order kinetic model was more
   suitable to predict experimental data. Sips model best described the
   equilibrium data, with maximum adsorption capacities of 145, 105, and 57
   mg g(-1) for paracetamol, ibuprofen, and ketoprofen, respectively.
   Besides, the sludge-derived adsorbent was highly efficient in the
   treatment of a simulated drug effluent, removing 85.16% of the
   pharmaceutical compounds. Therefore, the material prepared in this work
   possesses intrinsic characteristics that make it a remarkable adsorbent
   to be applied in the treatment of pharmaceutical contaminants contained
   in industrial wastewater. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Rapid population growth and the resultant pollution of freshwater
   sources are expected to create water stress conditions on the world in
   the near future. Adsorption technique is a popular method in reducing
   the amount of pollutants that enter water bodies, and researchers are
   focusing on development of activated carbons from cheap sources to
   replace costly commercial activated carbons. Remediation of wastewater
   using activated carbon from biowaste (defined in this paper as waste
   material derived from living organisms or of organic origin, and capable
   of decomposing under anaerobic or aerobic conditions) is gaining
   attention among researchers, as such technology reduces the cost of
   activated carbon production while reducing the cost on biowaste
   disposal. This paper summarizes recent development and findings on
   application of activated carbon synthesized from biowaste in wastewater
   treatment. Adsorption efficiencies of newly developed activated carbons
   in treatment of different pollutants (including dyes, metal ions,
   pharmaceutical and personal care products, organic pollutants) in
   simulated and real wastewater are also tabulated for easy reference. The
   potential of activated carbons modified with magnetic materials is also
   discussed, followed by recent advances and challenges in applications of
   activated carbons derived from biowaste in wastewater treatment. (C)

AB As it is well known, the textile industry generates a large amount of
   wastewater with varied composition that need to be treated. In
   particular, the Sergipe state, in Brazil, is a region that requires
   attention due the presence of several local textile industries. In this
   study, the efficiency of electrochemical oxidation (EO) process applied
   in the samples of Brazilian textile industry effluents previously
   treated by physical-chemical process coagulation-flocculation (CF) was
   evaluated by the reduction in TOC parameter and by the ecotoxicity using
   Lactuca sativa and Raphidocelis subcapitata bioassays. The optimized
   experiments achieved for the CF ([Al-2(SO4)(3)](0) = 1.5 mg L-1, pH =
   6.0, alkalinity = 0.675 mg L-1, [flocculating agent] = 61 mg L-1, rapid
   mixing = 100 rpm for 1 min, slow stage = 20-60 rpm for 20 min) a
   reduction of 20% on TOC. The best results obtained for EO was using the
   DSA electrode (I = 300 mA) reaching a TOC removal efficiency of 82%
   after an electrolysis time of 180 min. The ecotoxicity experiments
   indicated that the proposed treatment (CF + EO, I = 300 mA) was
   effective to decrease the dissolved pollutants presented in the treated
   samples. In comparison with raw samples, the treatment achieved a
   reduction of 52% for IC50(72h) value using R. subcapitata as
   bioindicator, and a 98% reduction of LC50 (Lactuca sativa). (C) 2019

AB Domestic wastewater treatment plants as a reservoir of antibiotic
   resistance genes (ARGs) have received much attention, but the effect of
   dyes on the propagation of ARGs has rarely been investigated. In this
   study, we investigated the differences in distributions of ARGs and
   microbial communities using high throughput qPCR and 16S rRNA gene
   sequencing, respectively, between mixed (dyeing and domestic) wastewater
   and domestic sewage. The relative abundance of ARGs in inflows of mixed
   wastewater (BM and lW3) was higher than that of domestic wastewater
   (IW1). The relative abundance of mobile genetic elements in the inflow
   of textile dyeing wastewater (IDW3) was 3- to 13-fold higher than that
   in other samples. Moreover, in IDW3, some distinct high abundance ARGs,
   particularly operons encoding efflux pumps (such as acrR-01, acrB-01 and
   acrF), were significantly correlated with Streptococcus of the
   Fir-micutes. To explore why the abundance of ARGs was relatively high in
   mixed wastewater, six representative types of organic compounds in
   textile dyeing wastewater were used to test the effect on plasmid-based
   conjugative transfer from E. coli HB101 to E. coil NK5449. These six
   compounds all facilitated the transfer of resistance-carrying RP4
   plasmid, and the highest transfer frequency (approximately
   10(-5)-10(-3)) was over 4- to 200-fold higher than that in the control
   group (approximately 10(-6)-10(-5)). These results illustrated that the
   six common residual compounds, particularly low-dose substances in IDW3,
   could facilitate the dissemination of ARGs in aquatic environments. More
   importantly, this study revealed for the first time that dyeing
   contaminants influenced horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of ARGs. (C) 2017

AB The practical applicability of decolorization techniques for synthetic
   textile wastewater (STW) mimicking real conditions in terms of organic
   matter and carbonate alkalinity content remains unclear. To address this
   issue, this study investigated the decolorization of an anthraquinone
   dye, Acid Blue 25 (AB-25), in STW using advanced oxidation processes
   (AOPs). The oxidation kinetics of AB-25 in STW and ultra-pure water
   (UPW) under UV-H2O2 and UV-TiO2 were comparatively studied. In UPW, the
   first-order rate constant with UV-TiO2 (0.5 g/L; k: 2.79x10(-2) 1/min)
   was more than twice that with UV-H2O2 (100 mg/L; k: 1.14x10(-2) 1/min),
   corresponding to 85% and 72% decolorization, respectively.
   Interestingly, in STW, the decolorization was slightly higher with
   UV-H2O2 than with UV-TiO2; at neutral pH, the first-order rate constants
   were 2.1x10(-3) 1/min and 1.8x10(-3) 1/min, accounting for 29% and 21%
   decolorization, respectively. This behavior can be attributed to the
   influence of background constituents, especially alkaline components
   (carbonate, bicarbonate). The combined influence of alkalinity and pH
   accounted for similar to 45%. For practical application, these results
   suggest that pH should be kept under 4.5 to ensure feasible treatment of
   STW via AOPs. Furthermore, the oxidation patterns reveal that
   decolorization of AB-25 results in the formation of sulfates due to
   desulfonation.

AB Polypyrrole-polyaniline nanofibres (PPy-PANI NFs), with interconnected
   structures were used for the removal of Congo red (CR) from aqueous
   solutions. The NFs were synthesised without template via coupling of
   propagating PPy center dot+ and PANI(center dot+) free radicals by in
   situ simultaneous polymerisation of Py and ANI monomers in the presence
   of a common oxidant, FeCl3. The as-prepared NFs were characterised by
   Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
   (ATR-FTIR) to confirm the presence of both PPy and PANI polymeric
   moieties. Interconnected and nanostructured fibres were observed by
   Field Emission-Scanning Electron Microscopic (FE-SEM) and High
   Resolution-Transmission Electron Microscopic (HR-TEM) images. The
   effects of various operational parameters including solution pH, contact
   time, initial concentration and temperature on removal of CR using
   PPy-PANI NFs were investigated in batch adsorption mode. Adsorption
   results demonstrated that the CR removal efficiency increased with
   decrease in solution pH. The adsorption kinetic data followed the
   pseudo-second-order equation whereas the equilibrium data fitted well to
   Langmuir model. The Langmuir maximum adsorption capacities (Q(max)) were
   found to be 222.22 mg/g and 270.27 mg/g at 25 degrees C and 35 degrees
   C, respectively. This indicates that the synthesised NFs showed better
   adsorption capacity of CR compared to many other adsorbents. Experiment
   with real textile wastewater spiked with CR showed 99.5% colour removal
   by the use of 0.1 g NFs. Finally, four consecutive adsorption-desorption
   experiments were conducted to test the reusability of the adsorbent and
   it revealed that the NFs retained the original capacity up to the third
   adsorption cycle. These results imply that the NFs are found to be an
   effective adsorbent for the removal of CR from water as a result of
   their interconnected nanostructure. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The morphology, structure, and properties
   of CM and CCSS were characterized by SEM, FTIR, and BET. The detection
   and anti-interference performance of CCSS for cadmium ions were
   investigated. In addition, the design and chromogenic reaction mechanism
   of CCSS were also studied. The results showed that CCSS was successfully
   prepared. The specific surface area, pore volume, and pore size of CCSS
   were decreased after VBB loading. The color of the CCSS changed from
   yellow to blue-green after cadmium ions were added. The limit of
   detection (LOD) was as low as 0.01 mg L-1 with the naked eye, and the
   fast response time of the strip for Cd(II) was 1 min. The CCSS was
   successfully applied to real water samples with strong anti-interference

AB In this study, rice husk biochar (RHB) and ZnO nanoparticles loaded rice
   husk biochar (RHB-ZnO-3 served to adsorb Reactive red 24 (RR24) in an
   aqueous solution. Effects of the ZnO nanoparticles loading ratio,
   solution pH, contact time, and initial RR24 concentration were evaluated
   utilizing detailed batch adsorption conditions. Isotherm and kinetic
   models helped to analyze the RR24 adsorption. Shown here is that the
   ratio of 3% (w/w) ZnO nanoparticles to RHB proved to be the best for
   fabricating highly effective modified rice husk biochar. In this
   scenario, the BET surface area of RHB-ZnO-3 was 13.84 m(2)/g, more than
   triple the original RHB (4.01 m(2)/g). Experimental results strongly
   suggest that RR24 highest adsorption capacities onto RHB-ZnO-3 and RHB
   were 174.91 mg/g and 88.51 mg/g, respectively. The best pH contact time
   and adsorbent rate for RR24 removal were 3, 60 min and 1.0 g/L,
   respectively. RR24 adsorption onto RHB and RHB-ZnO-3 were well described
   by Pseudo-second order kinetic and Langmuir isotherm models. Adsorption
   capacities of RHB and RHB-ZnO-3 did not diminish significantly after
   five cycles of adsorption-desorption. RHB and RHB-ZnO-3 could remove:
   firstly, more than half of the color and COD (50% color, 52.5% COD); and
   secondly, most of the turbidity (82.8%) from real textile wastewater.
   Electrostatic attraction, pi-pi interaction and pore filling were the
   main adsorption mechanisms of RR24 onto RHB and RHB-ZnO-3.

AB Chitosan (CS), synthesized from chitin chemically extracted from shrimp

   adsorption capacities (Q(m)) of 186.6 and 192.3mg/g were obtained for
   V(V) and Pd(II) ions, respectively. The pseudo-second-order equation
   gave the best fit for the kinetic data, implying that chemisorption was
   the determining step. Freundlich model yielded a much better fit than
   the other adsorption models assessed (Langmuir, Temkin and
   Dubinin-Radushkevich). Thus, the adsorption of V(V) and Pd(II) ions onto
   Fe3O4-CSN is a combination of physical and chemical adsorption, as based
   on the kinetics and equilibrium study. Generally, physical adsorption is
   the mechanism that governs the system, while chemical adsorption is the
   slowest adsorption step that takes place. Thermodynamic studies
   displayed that the adsorption process was exothermic and spontaneous.
   Removal efficiencies of 99.9% for V(V) and 92.3% for Pd(II) ions were
   achieved, implying that Fe3O4-CSN adsorbent had an excellent ability for
   the removal of the metal ions from real industrial wastewaters without
   remarkable matrix effect.

AB In the present study, the electrochemical oxidation of real wastewaters
   discharged by textile industry was carried out using a boron-doped
   diamond (BDD) anode. The effect of operational variables, such as
   applied current density (20-100 mA.cm(-2)), NaCl concentration added to
   the real wastewaters (0-3 g.L-1), and pH value (2.0-10.0), on the
   kinetics of COD oxidation and on the energy consumption was carefully
   investigated. The obtained experimental results could be well matched
   with a proposed kinetic model, in which the indirect oxidation mediated
   by electrogenerated strong oxidants would be described through a
   pseudo-first-order kinetic constant k. Values of k exhibited a linear
   increase with increasing applied current density and decreasing pH
   value, and an exponential increase with NaCl concentration. Furthermore,
   high oxidation kinetics resulted in low specific energy consumption, but
   this conclusion was not suitable to the results obtained under different
   applied current density. Under the optimum operational conditions, it
   only took 3 h to complete remove the COD in the real textile wastewaters
   and the specific energy consumption could be as low as 11.12 kWh.kg(-1)
   COD. The obtained results, low energy consumption and short electrolysis
   time, allowed to conclude that the electrochemical oxidation based on
   BDD anodes would have practical industrial application for the treatment
   of real textile wastewater. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Remediation of industrial wastewaters represents a stringent problem in
   modern society, which requires particular understanding and ad hoc
   solutions. In this work, we performed extensive experimental study of
   chemical Fenton oxidation in order to understand the optimal operative
   conditions to be applied in real industrial wastewaters treatment.
   We analyzed the effectiveness of chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal
   from different wastewaters within a wide range of initial COD content.
   We observed a maximum COD % removal of about 80%, assessing the
   efficiency of the process. In order to understand the role of different
   reagents in the final yield, we performed a factorial experimental
   approach on the Fenton's reagents (H2O2 and Fe2+) and analyzed the
   results developing an analytical second-order model.
   The model depends on three variables, namely: the initial [CODi] of the
   sample, the [CODi]/[H2O2] ratio and [H2O2]/[Fe2+] ratio. We obtained an
   accurate description of the COD % removal in different initial
   conditions, with a R-2 = 0.85.
   In particular, we observed that optimal quantities of Fenton's reagents
   are a function of the initial COD of the treated wastes. (C) 2010

AB A novel submerged membrane bioreactor integrated with ozonation and
   photocatalysis has been developed to treat the real textile wastewater
   and study the fouling behaviour. This study evaluates the performance
   efficiency in pilot-scale for the three reactors such as membrane
   bioreactor, ozonised membrane bioreactor and further clubbed with
   photocatalysis. The membrane filtration consists of polyvinilidine
   difluoride hollow fibre membrane module having pore size 0.1 mu m.
   Tungsten oxide, a visible photocatalyst was made into spongy alginate
   beads and used in photocatalytic reactor. The photocatalyst dose has
   been optimised as 500 mg/L. About 10% membrane filterability ratio has
   been achieved by integrating ozone with MBR with the maximal ozone
   dosage of 5 g/h. It showed better removal efficiency in colour and
   chemical oxygen demand of 94% and 93% respectively. The biodegradability
   efficiency also was enhanced from 0.2 to 0.4 with optimised ozone dosage
   (5 g/h). The study on reversible and irreversible fouling has been done
   to understand the fouling nature. The important analysis such as
   microbial community and scanning electron microscopy analysis were done
   to study the biofouling and extent of fouling after filtration. The
   treatability studies implemented for textile wastewater showed that
   integrated MBR systems are suitable in meeting the discharge norms
   prescribed by the Indian statutory body in terms of chemical oxygen
   demand, colour and total suspended solids.

AB Micropollutants such as pharmaceutical active compounds, present at high
   concentration in hospital wastewater (HWW), pose both environmental and
   human health challenges. Fungal reactors can effectively remove such
   contaminants and produce non-toxic effluents, but their ability to
   operate for a long period of time is yet to be demonstrated in real
   hospital wastewater. Several process variables need to be studied
   beforehand. Here, variables: pellet size, aeration and
   carbon-to-nitrogen ratio are studied in continuous operations with real
   HWW. Moreover, a novel strategy for inoculum production that could
   reduce economical and operational costs is proposed and tested. Optimum
   pellet size was found to be 2 mm and an aeration of 0.8 L min(-1) was
   needed to maintain fungal viability. The carbon-to-nitrogen ratio of 7.5
   was selected and the pellet production time was reduced from 6 to 3
   days. The novel low-cost inoculum preparation produced pellets with the
   same characteristics as the traditionally prepared ones. (C) 2018

AB Electrochemical oxidative degradation (EOD) is a particularly promising
   technique for removing organic pollutants from wastewater. However, due
   to the high overpotential of EOD in conventional anode materials, the
   energy cost of EOD is usually very high, which greatly promotes the
   search for highly active, stable, and energy-efficient anodic catalysts.
   Herein, we demonstrated that nickel-foam-supported (NF-supported)
   -Ni(OH)(2) (NF/-Ni(OH)(2)) prepared via a facile hydrothermal method
   could be used as an energy efficient anode for EOD. The as-prepared 3D
   porous NF/-Ni(OH)(2) exhibited high activity toward the electrochemical
   oxidation of methyl orange (MO) in the low potential region (<1.07 V vs.
   SCE). This property differs greatly from those of the conventional anode
   materials that require a high positive potential to keep them active for
   EOD, making NF/-Ni(OH)(2) an energy-efficient and active anode material
   for EOD. With an oxidation current density of 0.25 mA cm(-2), the
   decolorization of MO was completed within 30 min, and the COD removal
   after 3h of reaction was 63.0%. The normalized energy consumption for
   the 3 h degradation of MO was 22.2 kW h (kg COD)(-1), which is only a
   fraction of (or even one tenth of) the values reported in the
   literature. Moreover, NF/-Ni(OH)(2) had a good stability and
   recyclability for EOD. No activity decay was observed during 10 h of EOD
   and the COD removal remained almost unchanged after four consecutive
   reaction cycles. We demonstrated experimentally that the NF/-Ni(OH)(2)
   anode could generate large amounts of hydroxyl radicals and that the
   oxidation of MO by hydroxyl radicals was the main mechanism during EOD.
   We believe that this work opens a new avenue for developing highly
   active and energy-efficient anode materials that can work in the low
   potential region for EOD.

AB BACKGROUND: Electrochemical methods, as one of the advanced oxidation
   processes (AOPs), have recently been applied to remove different
   contaminants from water and wastewater. This study compares the
   performance of anodic oxidation (AO) and electro-Fenton (EF) methods on
   waste sludge treatment.
   METHODS: This experimental study was performed on real sludge and the
   effect of operating parameters such as solution pH, operating time,
   current density, supporting electrolyte and hydrogen peroxide
   concentration were investigated in a batch reactor. For determination of
   oxidation and treatability of the sludge, chemical oxygen demand (COD)
   and total coliform (TC) removal were examined. Pb/PbO2 and iron
   electrodes respectively for AO and EF were applied.
   RESULTS: Experimental data indicated for both AO and EF as the operating
   time and current density increased, COD removal increased. pH=4.0 and
   3.0 and current density=1.75 and 2 A respectively for AO and EF and the
   concentration = 57.2 mMol of hydrogen peroxide for EF were measured as
   the optimum amounts of these variables. The removal efficiency of COD in
   AO and EF process was 76% and 72%, respectively. Of course, the
   efficiency of EF in TC removal was better and the percentage of TC
   removal in 60 min for AO and EF was 99.0% and 99.9%, respectively. The
   amounts of consumed electrical energy for AO and EF were 8.6 and 28.0
   kWh kg-1 COD, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: AO was more effective in treatment and mineralization of
   waste sludge and TC removal than EF in terms of environmental economical
   features.

AB To gain systematic technology for long-chain dicarboxylic acids (LDCA)
   manufacturing wastewater treatment, catalytic micro-electrolysis (CME)
   coupling with adsorption-biodegradation sludge (AB) process was studied.
   Firstly, novel catalytic-ceramic-filler was prepared from scrap iron,
   clay and copper sulfate solution and packed in the CME reactor. To
   remove residual n-alkane and LDCA, the CME reactor was utilized for LDCA
   wastewater pretreatment. The results revealed that about 94% of
   n-alkane, 98% of LDCA and 84% of chemical oxygen demand (COD) were
   removed by the aerated CME reactor at the optimum hydraulic retention
   time (HRT) of 3.0 h. In this process, catalysis from Cu and
   montmorillonites played an important role in improving the contaminants
   removal. Secondly, to remove residual COD in the wastewater, AB process
   was designed for the secondary biological treatment, about 90% of the
   influent COD could be removed by biosorption, bio-flocculation and
   biodegradation effects. Finally, the effluent COD (about 150 mg L-1)
   discharged from the coupled CME-AB system met the requirement of the
   national discharged standard (COD <= 300 mg L-1). All of these results
   suggest that the coupled CME-AB system is a promising technology due to
   its high-efficient performance, and has the potential to be applied for
   the real LDCA wastewater treatment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Aqueous mixtures of methyl, ethyl and propyl paraben (MeP, EtP and PrP)
   prepared in real urban wastewater with low conductivity were treated by
   solar photoelectro-Fenton (SPEF) process at low input current (j = 10 mA
   cm(-2)) using a pre-pilot plant with an electrochemical reactor equipped
   with an air-diffusion cathode to electrogenerate H2O2 and a boron-doped
   diamond (BDD) or RuO2-based anode. Comparative trials in simulated water
   matrices with or without Cl- in the absence of natural organic matter
   (NOM) always led to a slower decay of parabens concentration and total
   organic carbon (TOC). This was mainly due to the superior regeneration
   of Fe2+ from photoreduction of Fe(III) complexes formed with NOM in real
   wastewater compared to that from Fe(OH)(2+). In all matrices, a catalyst
   concentration as low as 0.20 mM Fe2+ was enough to ensure the production
   of center dot OH in the bulk from Fenton's reaction. SPEF with BDD
   yielded a complete removal of parabens in 180 min and 66% mineralization
   at 240 min. This gave rise to the greatest mineralization current
   efficiencies reported so far, up to 1000%, with a low energy consumption
   of 84 kWh (kg TOC)(-1). The synergy between homogeneous and
   heterogeneous catalysis, which allowed the efficient dosage of center
   dot OH and M(center dot OH) at low j, with simultaneous action of high
   UV power from sunlight justified such a good performance. Analogous
   apparent rate constants were determined for MeP, EtP and PrP. Slower
   decays were found with RuO2-based anode due to its lower oxidation
   power. As a result, the MCE was 425% as maximum, but a lower energy
   consumption of 52 kWh (kg TOC)(-1) was needed. Since the role of active
   chlorine was of minor importance, the formation of toxic, refractory
   chloroderivatives was minimized. All by-products were transformed into
   malic, formic and oxalic acids prior to total mineralization.

AB The search of novel photocatalysts active under solar radiation has been
   object of extensive work over the last decades. Alkaline earth
   titanates, i.e. CaTiO3, SrTiO3 and BaTiO3, are perovskites oxides with
   promising photocatalytic properties due to their band gaps of
   respectively 3.65, 3.20 and 3.00 eV. SrTiO3 and BaTiO3 present adequate
   band gaps and band alignment for activation with solar radiation and
   produce radicals for the oxidation of aqueous pollutants or electrons
   with enough redox potential to reduce aqueous hexavalent chromium. This
   review provides a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art on the
   applications of alkaline earth metal titanate-based photocatalysts
   focused on the abatement of water pollutants. Some strategies have been
   extensively explored with the aim of extending radiation absorption to
   the visible range. Doping, metal deposition onto the surface, and the
   combination in double, or sometimes ternary, hybrid hetemstructures have
   improved the photocatalytic performance of titanates by decreasing the
   band gap energy and enabling the formation of defects that minimize
   electron-hole recombination. The presence of carbonaceous materials also
   contributes to the delocalization of the photogenerated electrons. This
   review summarizes the commonly used methods for titanates preparation
   and their characterization. The main attention of this review is focused
   on the discussion of the relevant achievements of pristine and
   titanates-based photocatalysts on the removal of dyes, contaminants of
   emerging concern and reduction of hexavalent chromium. Also, some
   critical points that might compromise their use in a future real
   application are discussed; in particular, those dealing with problems of
   expensiveness or leaching of toxic metals. Finally, the techniques
   commonly used for the assessment of the contribution of different
   reactive oxidation species, mainly hydroxyl and superoxide radials, are
   overviewed.

AB Concrete in construction has recently gained media coverage for its
   negative CO(2)footprint, but this is not the only problem associated
   with its use. Due to its chemical composition, freshly poured concrete
   changes the pH of water coming in contact with the surface to very
   alkaline values, requiring neutralization treatment before disposal.
   Conventional methods include the use of mineral acid or CO(2)pumps,
   causing high costs to building companies. In this paper, we present a
   micromotor based remediation strategy, which consists of carbonate
   particles half-coated with citric acid. To achieve this half coverage
   spray coating is used for the first time to design Janus structures. The
   motors propel diffusiophoretically due to a self-generated gradient
   formed as the acid coverage dissolves. The locally lower pH contributes
   to the dissolution of the carbonate body. These motors have been
   employed to study neutralization of diluted concrete wash water (CWW) at

AB Water reuse for drinking, irrigation, district cooling, process
   heating/cooling, landscaping, etc. remains pivotal to water security and
   sustainability. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are at the heart of
   the industrial wastewater treatment especially for the removal of
   contaminants of emerging concern. Recent studies conducted to advance
   AOP technologies for the degradation of industrial wastewater pollutants
   generally encompass seven areas, namely artificial neural networks
   (ANNs), sustainability, plasma activation, catalyst structures,
   AOP-Bioremediation, and membrane-based AOPs. This review presents the
   advancements in AOPs for oxidation and removal of a wide range of
   contaminants of emerging concern from water. Detailed discussions and a
   critical examination of recently published works are presented in this
   article. Many of the reports have recorded technical progress in the
   form of: improved energy efficiency through the use of low-energy and
   renewable energy sources, successful prediction of process performance
   and process control, improved light capturing capabilities through
   plasmonic effect, successful integration with biological treatment
   methods and membrane filtration. In spite of this progress, a number of
   challenges still persist such as lack of appropriate ANN modeling
   structures, impractical spatial and temporal scales of investigation
   (i.e. scales that are too low for real operations), and membrane fouling
   in membrane-based AOPs. These challenges and the strategies for
   addressing them are discussed in this article. (C) 2020 Institution of

AB In this study, the effect of salinity on degradation of model
   environmental pollutants (organic dyes and E. coil) was investigated
   using polyethylene glycol (PEG) assisted P/Ag/Ag2O/Ag3PO4/TiO2
   photocatalyst. The photocatalyst was firstly synthesized with structure
   modifier PEG to determine the optimum molecular weight by solgel method,
   and was characterized by XRD, UV-Vis, PL, SEM, TEM, EDS, and
   photocurrent experiment. The PEG(300) modified P/Ag/Ag2O/Ag3PO4/TiO2
   photocatalyst was found to be the optimal molecular weight which
   exhibited small crystalline size, narrow band gap, better absorption
   ability, smaller particles size, large photocurrent density, low
   recombination rate and higher photocatalytic activity among other PEG
   modified photocatalyst. The PEG(300) -P/Ag/Ag2O/Ag3PO4/TiO2
   photocatalytic degradation of emerging organic pollutants such as
   rhodamine B, methyl orange, and methylene blue was significantly higher
   at aqueous NaCl (2.6 and 3.2 wt%) and artificial salinity (25 and 35
   parts per thousand) compared to freshwater under simulated solar light
   illumination. Furthermore, the elimination of organic dyes under
   different environmental factors such as initial pH, light intensity,
   reaction temperature showed substantial degradation in real
   environmental conditions at salinity. Moreover, PEG(300)
   -P/Ag/Ag2O/Ag3PO4/TiO2 photocatalyst demonstrated high practicability on
   complete inactivation of E. coil, simultaneous degradation of organic
   dyes, and high stability in seawater. Superoxide anion (O-center dot(2)-
   ) radicals was found to be the dominant reactive species, and subsequent
   formation of Cl and free chlorine oxidative agents further improved the
   photocatalytic purification process. The PEG(300) -P/Ag/Ag2O/Ag3PO4/TiO2
   photocatalyst showed great potential in treating environmental organic
   pollutants at salinity condition under solar light illumination.

AB Sewage sludge from a biological wastewater treatment plant was converted
   into sewage sludge based activated carbon (SBAC) with ZnCl2 as
   activation agent, which was used as a support for ferric oxides to form
   a catalyst (FeOx/SBAC) by a simple impregnation method. The new material
   was then used to improve the performance of Fenton oxidation of real
   biologically pretreated coal gasification wastewater (CGW). The results
   indicated that the prepared FeOx/SBAC significantly enhanced the
   pollutant removal performance in the Fenton process, so that the treated
   wastewater was more biodegradable and less toxic. The best performance
   was obtained over a wide pH range from 2 to 7, temperature 30 degrees C,
   15 mg/L of H2O2 and 1 g/L of catalyst, and the treated effluent
   concentrations of COD, total phenols, BOD5 and TOC all met the discharge
   limits in China. Meanwhile, on the basis of significant inhibition by a
   radical scavenger in the heterogeneous Fenton process as well as the
   evolution of FT-IR spectra of pollutant-saturated FeOx/BAC with and
   without H2O2, it was deduced that the catalytic activity was responsible
   for generating hydroxyl radicals, and a possible reaction pathway and
   interface mechanism were proposed. Moreover, FeOx/SBAC showed superior
   stability over five successive oxidation runs. Thus, heterogeneous
   Fenton oxidation of biologically pretreated CGW by FeOx/SBAC, with the
   advantages of being economical, efficient and sustainable, holds promise
   for engineering application. (C) 2015 The Research Center for

AB Fenton oxidation and ultrasound-based pretreatment have been applied to
   improve the treatment of real industrial wastewater based on the use of
   biological oxidation. The effect of operating parameters such as Fe2+
   loading, contact time, initial pH, and hydrogen peroxide loading on the
   extent of chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction and change in
   biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5)/COD ratio has been investigated. The
   optimum operating conditions established for the pretreatment were
   initial pH of 3.0, Fe2+ loading of 2.0, and 2.5 g L-1 for the
   US/Fenton/stirring and Fenton approach, respectively, and temperature of
   25 degrees C with initial H2O2 loading of 1.5 g L-1. The use of
   pretreatment resulted in a significant increase in the BOD5/COD ratio
   confirming the production of easily digestible intermediates. The effect
   of the type of sludge in the aerobic biodegradation was also
   investigated based on the use of primary activated sludge (PAS),
   modified activated sludge (MAS), and activated sludge (AS). Enhanced
   removal of the pollutants as well as higher biomass yield was observed
   for MAS as compared to PAS and AS. The use of US/Fenton/stirring
   pretreatment under the optimized conditions followed by biological
   oxidation using MAS resulted in maximum COD removal at 97.9 %. The
   required hydraulic retention time for the combined oxidation system was
   also significantly lower as compared to only biological oxidation
   operation. Kinetic studies revealed that the reduction in the COD
   followed a first-order kinetic model for advanced oxidation and pseudo
   first-order model for biodegradation. The study clearly established the
   utility of the combined technology for the effective treatment of real
   industrial wastewater.

AB White-rot fungi (WRF) and their ligninolytic enzymes have been
   investigated for the removal of a broad spectrum of trace organic
   contaminants (TrOCs) mostly from synthetic wastewater in lab-scale
   experiments. Only a few studies have reported the efficiency of such
   systems for the removal of TrOCs from real wastewater. Wastewater
   derived organic and inorganic compounds can inhibit: (i) WRF growth and
   their enzyme production capacity; (ii) enzymatic activity of
   ligninolytic enzymes; and (iii) catalytic efficiency of both WRF and
   enzymes. It is observed that essential metals such as Cu, Mn and Co at
   trace concertation (up to 1 mM) can improve the growth of WRF species,
   whereas non-essential metal such as Pb, Cd and Hg at 1 mM concentration
   can inhibit WRF growth and their enzyme production. In the case of
   purified enzymes, most of the tested metals at 1-5 mM concentration do
   not significantly inhibit the activity of laccases. Organic interfering
   compounds such as oxalic acid and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)
   at 1 mM concentration are potent inhibitors of WRF and their
   extracellular enzymes. However, inhibitory effects induced by
   interfering compounds are strongly influenced by the type of WRF species
   as well as experimental conditions (e.g., incubation time and TrOC
   type). In this review, mechanisms and factors governing the interactions
   of interfering compounds with WRF and their ligninolytic enzymes are
   reviewed and elucidated. In addition, the performance of WRF and their
   ligninolytic enzymes for the removal of TrOCs from synthetic and real
   wastewater is critically summarized. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Recycling of alternative water sources particularly greywater and
   recovery of energy from wastewater are gaining momentum due to clean
   water scarcity and energy crisis. In this study, the photocatalytic fuel
   cell (PFC) employing ZnO/Zn photoanode and CuO/Cu photocathode was
   successfully designed for effective greywater recycling as well as
   energy recovery. The photoelectrodes were analyzed using X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM),
   energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
   spectroscopy. The PFC performance in terms of electricity generation and
   parallel methyl green (MG) degradation were evaluated under operating
   parameters such as electrolyte type, initial MG concentration and
   solution pH. The results showed that the addition of Na2SO4 electrolyte,
   MG concentration of 40 mg L-1 and solution pH of 5.2 improved the short
   circuit current density (J(sc)) and power density (P-max) in the
   as-constructed PFC. Such a system also afforded highest MG and chemical
   oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiencies after 4 h of irradiation. The
   photoanodes used in this study demonstrated great recyclability after
   four repetition tests. The COD removal was reduced to some extents when
   the PFC treatment was tested in the real greywater under optimal
   conditions. Various greywater quality parameters including ammoniacal
   nitrogen (NH3-N), turbidity, pH and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5)
   were also monitored. The phytotoxicity experiments via Vigna radiate
   seeds indicated a reduction in the phytotoxicity.

AB The aim of this research was to develop a simple and inexpensive process
   for reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III). Zinc oxide nanoparticles were
   synthesized with an easy co-precipitation procedure, and the addition of
   Cu2+ doping agent effectively enhanced the Cr(VI) reduction in the
   presence of ultrasound (US). XRD, FT-IR, FE-SEM, EDX, VSM, and XPS were
   used to determine the structural specifications of the zinc oxide
   nanoparticles. Under optimal conditions such as pH 3, initial Cr(VI)
   content of 20 mg/L, and catalyst dosage of 0.8 g/L, the
   ultrasonic/Cu-ZnO process showed a higher sonocatalytic activity
   (96.83%) than ultrasonic/ZnO (67.36%) after 60 min. By increasing pH and
   Cr(VI) concentration, the removal efficacy of Cr(VI) declined. The
   experimental data was well described with the first-order kinetic model.
   When initial Cr(VI) concentration increased from 10 to 50 mg/L, the
   first-order rate constant declined from 0.2326 to 0.0019 min(-1) and
   electrical energy per order (E-EO) enhanced from 19.81 to 2425.26
   kWh/m(3). Also, the ultrasonic/Cu-ZnO system exhibited considerable
   sonocatalytic performance in Cr(VI) reduction in the presence of
   hydrogen peroxide and citric acid, and complete removal was achieved
   within 60 min. The presence of anions negatively affected Cr(VI)
   reduction. Complete reduction was attained when ultrasound was applied
   at a power of 100 W. The catalyst activity was well maintained up to six
   consecutive cycles. In addition, the removal efficiency was
   approximately 62 and 65% for field water and real electroplating
   wastewater samples, respectively.

AB Constructing highly efficient metal-free material towards
   peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation under photocatalyfic assistance is a
   promising strategy for water decontamination. Herein, N vacancy modified
   g-C3N4 nanotube (VCN) was prepared to build a novel photo-assisted PMS
   activation system (PPAS), in which the unique electronic structure
   created by N vacancy could favor the PMS activation on VCN under
   visible-light irradiation. The role of N vacancy in PPAS was firstly
   studied through tuning its content in VCN. The results showed that the N
   vacancy greatly improved PMS activation on VCN PPAS towards organic
   pollutants removal. The VCN PPAS with moderate N vacancy modification
   performed best, whose kinetic constant for Rhodamine B degradation was
   9.6 and 2.6 times higher than that of VCN/PMS system and pristine g-C3N4
   PPAS, respectively. Moreover, the VCN PPAS performed well in wide pH
   range (3-12) and real water background. Selective removal of different
   organic pollutants was found on VCN PPAS, owing to the different
   interaction between pollutant and the catalyst surface with
   surface-bound radicals. The O-2(center dot-) and center dot OH were
   major oxidants for pollutant removal in VCN PPAS, which were produced on
   dual active sites of VCN via two pathways: The N vacancy enhanced PMS
   adsorption and trapped photogenerated electrons for PMS reduction into
   center dot OH, while the electron-deficient C atoms created by N loss
   promoted the PMS oxidation into O-2(center dot-). (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB In recent years, photoelectrocatalysis (PEC) for the treatment of
   industrial wastewaters (IWWs) has been repeatedly proposed. However,
   despite the number of tests reported in literature, only a few of them
   were conducted on real IWWs. In this study, real pharmaceutical IWWs
   showing an intense recalcitrant color were treated by PEC and
   H2O2-assisted PEC (UV/TiO2/Bias and UV/H2O2/TiO2/Bias, respectively) on
   TiO2 meshes having sub-micrometric features obtained by Plasma
   Electrolytic Oxidation. Photolysis (UV), chemical oxidation (H2O2) and
   H2O2-assisted photolysis (UV/H2O2) were tested in the same reactor for
   comparison. The configuration UV/H2O2/TiO2/bias showed the best results
   in term of decolorization efficiency and rate, where decolorization was
   55 % (single-step H2O2 dosing) and 44 % (three-step H2O2 dosing), after
   2 h of contact time. In the same contact time, UV and UV/TiO2/Bias
   processes did not give decolorization. A more effective COD removal was
   measured for the PEC processes, UV/H2O2/TiO2/Bias (-24 %) and
   UV/TiO2/Bias (-20 %), while COD removal by UV was almost 0 %.
   Correspondingly, the SOUR values showed that PEC combined with a
   single-step H2O2 dosage was the most effective configuration, leading to
   the highest biodegradability of the treated IWW with respect to the
   other processes. The energy consumption analysis demonstrated that PEC+
   H2O2 (single-step dosage) optimized energy costs.

   g(-1) and similar to 890 mg g(-1) for cadmium and lead ion,
   respectively. Simultaneous metal ion removal experiments in binary metal
   ion systems indicated an increase in adsorption capacity with a maximum
   value of similar to 1000 mg g(-1) for lead ion adsorption and a decrease
   in adsorption capacity with a maximum value of similar to 580 mg g(-1)
   for cadmium ion adsorption. This observation suggested that the lead and
   cadmium ion adsorption process is affected by the synergistic and
   antagonistic effects, respectively. Experimental results indicate that
   the process followed the Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-second-order
   kinetics irrespective of the systems when the adsorption experiments
   were done in single and binary metal ion-containing systems.
   Thermodynamic studies indicated endothermicity and spontaneity of the
   process. The kinetic experiments showed that the film diffusion
   dominates the metal ion adsorption process.

AB Discharge of recalcitrant pharmaceuticals into aquatic environments can
   lead to serious negative envi-ronmental effects. While traditional
   wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are efficient for a wide range of
   non-toxic pollutants (i.e. ammonia), some wastewater streams contain
   recalcitrant toxic trace micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals that
   cannot be removed by the treatment processes that are typically employed
   in common WWTPs. Herein, an innovative 20 L microbial electrochemical
   ultraviolet photolysis cell (MEUC) was developed for the first time by
   the integration of a UV irradiation and a bioelectrochemical system,
   which exhibited efficient treatment of carbamazepine-a model
   pharmaceutical compound. Notably, neither the UV irradiation nor the
   bioelectrochemical system alone could effectively eliminate
   carbamazepine. The effect of operational parameters including applied
   voltage, cathodic aeration rate, UV intensity, and hydraulic retention
   time were evaluated. The obtained results elucidated that the
   degradation of carbamazepine was consistent with pseudo-first-order
   reaction kinetics, and required a lower energy input than traditional
   advanced oxidation processes. Five main transformation products were
   identified, and probable transformation pathways were established.
   Furthermore, the eco-toxicity as tested by Vibrio fischeri showed no
   significant bioluminescence inhibition by the treated carbamazepine
   effluent. Finally, the MEUC system was further tested with a real
   wastewater matrix, which again exhibited effective removal of
   carbamazepine. This paper provides a proof-of-concept verification of
   the novel MEUC system, which contributes insight for the subsequent
   vigorous development of the application of such efficient and
   cost-effective technologies for the treatment of trace pharmaceuticals
   wastewater. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Micelles have unique solubilizing properties. Here has been exploited
   the solid supported micellar bilayer (called admicelle) to extract
   Cu(II) ion from aqueous medium via adsorption, or more appropriately
   called adsolubilization. The adsorbent used in the present study is
   alumina modified with anionic surfactant. The material has been
   designated as surfactant-modified alumina (SMA). Batch adsorption
   results show efficient Cu(II) extraction (94.45%) by SMA at equilibrium
   conditions. The batch adsorption of Cu(II) obeyed Freundlich isotherm
   and pseudo second order kinetic model. Thermodynamic parameters (Delta
   G, Delta H, and Delta S) indicate that the adsorption process is
   spontaneous, endothermic, and favorable. Desorption of copper from
   Cu(II)-adsorbed SMA is possible by 0.2 M Na-2-EDTA. The applicability of
   SMA for the removal of Cu(II) from Cu(II)-spiked real wastewater has
   been examined. The results show that SMA is capable of treating
   wastewater containing Cu(II) having an initial concentration of 20 mg
   L-1 with approximately 92% removal efficiency. The same amount (up to
   similar to 92%) has been recovered again by Na-2-EDTA treatment. A
   continuous fixed-bed column study has been performed for the design of
   adsorption columns. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB The degradation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, a ubiquitous component of
   olive oil mill wastewater (OOMW), has been studied by anodic oxidation
   with electrogenerated H2O2 (AO-H2O2), electro-Fenton (EF) and
   photoelectro-Fenton (PEF). Experiments were performed in either a 0.050
   M Na2SO4 solution or a real 00MW at pH 3.0, using a cell with a
   boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode and an air-diffusion cathode for H2O2
   generation. Hydroxyl radicals formed at the BDD surface from water
   oxidation in all processes and/or in the bulk from Fenton's reaction
   between added Fe2+ and generated H2O2 in EF and PEF were the main
   oxidants. In both matrices, the oxidation ability of the processes
   increased in the order AO H2O2 < EF < PEF. The superiority of PEF was
   due to the photolytic action of UVA radiation on photosensitive
   by-products, as deduced from the quick removal of Fe(III)-oxalate
   complexes. The effect of current density and organic content on the
   performance of all treatments was examined. 4-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid
   decay obeyed a pseudo-first-order kinetics. The PEF treatment of 1.03 mM
   4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid in 0.050 M Na2SO4 allowed 98% mineralization
   at 360 min even at low current density, whereas 80% mineralization and a
   significant enhancement of biodegradability were achieved with the real
   00MW. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, nanostructured TiO2 film was prepared by the by sol-gel
   process and dip-coating technique with titanium tetraisopropoxide as a
   precursor. After heat treatment at 550 degrees C, the deposited film was
   characterized by means of micro-Raman spectroscopy and atomic force
   microscopy (AFM). It was found that the TiO2 film consisted of only the
   TiO2 anatase phase and showed a granular microstructure. Photocatalytic
   degradation of azithromycin by using sol-gel nanostructured TiO2 film
   was studied to define the most effective degradation process for
   potential use in wastewater treatment. Different factors were evaluated
   during photocatalysis, such as pH (3, 7, and 10), water matrix
   (ultrapure water and synthetic municipal waste water effluent),
   influence of another pharmaceutically active compound (sulfamethoxazole,
   one of the most often detected pharmaceutic compounds in waste waters),
   and radiation sources (low pressure ultraviolet (UV) mercury lamps with
   a UV-A and UV-C range; a light-emitting diode (LED) lamp with a
   radiation peak at 365 nm). The most effective degradation process was
   achieved with the UV-C irradiation source in matrices at pH 10. The
   water matrix had little effect on the photocatalytic degradation rates
   of azithromycin. The presence of sulfamethoxazole in the water matrix
   decreased the degradation rate of azithromycin, however, only in
   matrices with a pH level adjusted to 10. During the experiments, five
   azithromycin degradation products were identified and none of them
   showed toxic properties, suggesting effective removal of azithromycin.
   LED 365 nm as the irradiation source was not as effective as the UV-C
   lamp. Nevertheless, considering the cost, energy efficiency, and
   environmental aspects of the irradiation source, the LED lamp could be a
   "real-life" alternative.

AB In this study, the effectiveness of the HSO5-/Mn+/UV process on the
   treatment of winery wastewater (WW) was investigated. The optimal
   operating conditions were determined: [HSO5-] = 2.5 mM; [M-2(SO4)(n)] =
   1.0 mM; pH = 6.5 and reaction temperature = 323 K. Under the given
   conditions, 51%, 42% and 35% of COD removal was achieved using
   respectively Fe(II), Co(II) and Cu(II) as catalysts. Different UV
   sources were tested with the previously selected optimal conditions in
   order to increase the treatment efficiency. The highest COD removal
   (82%) was achieved using a UV-A LEDs system (70 W/m(2)). These
   conditions were also promising for the treatment of WW with COD
   concentrations of 5000 mg O-2/L, reaching 79% and 64% of COD and TOC
   removal, respectively, after 180 min of treatment. At 323 K, the most
   effective treatment was obtained when Co(II) was used as catalyst (79%
   and 64% of COD and TOC removal), while at ambient temperature (293 K)
   the highest COD (65%) and TOC (52%) removals were obtained with Fe(II)
   catalyst. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the use of HSO5-/Mn+ in
   several consecutive doses was more efficient than adding the reagents as
   a single dose at the beginning of the reaction. A comparison between the
   performance of the HSO5-/Fe(II)/UV-A LED process and the conventional
   photo-Fenton demonstrated important advantages associated with the
   HSO5-/Fe(II)/UV-A LED process, including the absence of the costly pH
   adjustment and of the hydroxide ferric sludge which characterise the
   photo-Fenton treatment process. The HSO5-/Mn+/UV-A LED process
   demonstrates a high COD and TOC removal efficiency, and it can be
   considered a promising technology for application in real scale
   agro-food wastewater treatment plants. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Cost-efficient synthesis of biomass-derived carbon-based adsorbents
   having high adsorption capacity for waste-water treatment has been
   reported. Multi-doped carbon fibers (MCFs) derived from pyrolysis of
   chicken featherfiber (CFF) have been investigated for their adsorption
   characteristics for organic water-pollutants. Effects of various
   structural parameters such as microstructure and surface chemical state
   of the MCFs on their adsorption properties have been investigated. The
   maximum adsorption capacity of similar to 170 mg/g is observed for the
   MCF synthesized at the pyrolysis temperature of 600 degrees C.
   Correlations between the adsorption capacities of the MCFs with their
   surface functionalities suggest the sp(2) carbon to be the most active
   adsorption site. The Weber and Morris diffusion model suggests that
   surface adsorption and intraparticle diffusion play significant roles
   during MB adsorption on the MCFs. Further, the adsorption process
   follows Langmuir isotherms with a monolayer adsorption. Negative change
   in enthalpy with MB adsorption reveals the exothermic nature of the
   adsorption process. Furthermore, the MCFs exhibit high stability under
   aqueous solutions. This, combined with the adsorption studies using
   real-life wastewater samples, suggests the CFF derived MCFs to be the
   suitable adsorbents for large-scale wastewater treatment applications.

   Ul(-1)) were observed in fungal-bacterial cultures compared to pure P.
   ostreatus despite a limited growth of bacteria in mixed cultures.
   According to 16S-rDNA analyses, P. ostreatus was able to alter the
   structure of bacterial communities. In malt extract-glucose medium the
   fungus inhibited growth of planktonic bacteria and prevented shifts in
   bacterial utilization of potential C-sources. A model bacterium,

AB Potential of the magnetic hollow-sphere nanocomposite, graphene
   oxide-gadolinium oxide (GO-Gd2O3) for arsenic (As) removal from real
   field water with developing a continuous operating system and
   antimicrobial activity were investigated. The characterization results
   suggest that the prepared GO-Gd2O3 is a hallow sphere wool-like
   nanocomposite having 50.91 m(2) g(-1) surface area. The sorption studies
   revealed that a high adsorption capacity (216.70 mg g(-1)) can be
   achieved using GO-Gd2O3 (0.1 g L-1) at a pH of 6.0, and temperature of
   293 K. The main and novel observations from the loading of Gd2O3 are
   that the GO adsorption efficiency, adsorbent separation rate from
   aqueous solutions, and the stability of the composite have been altered.
   Thus, the developed material can overcome the separation and stability
   issues associated with the bare GO, and exhibits an enhanced adsorption
   capacity toward arsenic was higher or comparable with existing magnetic
   material. In addition, the developed adsorption method was well applied
   for real field water samples collected from the mining area of South
   Korea where the GO-Gd2O3 can reduce the quantity of arsenic under the
   maximum accepted concentration of arsenic considered fit for drinking
   water stipulated by environmental protection agencies. Furthermore, the
   GO-Gd2O3 nanocomposite shows a high bacterial photocatalytic
   inactivation and was comparable with other reports.

   the sawdust and successful quaternization with a nitrogen content of
   5.75%. The highest vanadium removal (96.2%) was achieved at pH 4 (dosage
   1 g/L, initial vanadium concentration 19.1 mg/L). Equilibrium was
   achieved within 8 h of contact time and the adsorption kinetics were
   well fitted with the pseudo-second-order model. Both film diffusion and
   intra-particle diffusion contributed to the adsorption process, while
   the latter was the rate-limiting step. The maximum vanadium adsorption
   capacity of TEA-I-SD (35.0 mg/g, pH 4) was close to the theoretical
   value obtained from the Langmuir model. The best fit was achieved with
   the Redlich-Peterson model, exhibiting a monolayer adsorption
   phenomenon. Tests with real mine water containing 11 mg/L of vanadium
   also confirmed its high removal (91.3%, dosage 1 g/L) using TEA-I-SD at
   pH 4. The TEA-I-SD could be reused three times without significant
   capacity loss after regeneration, although the desorption efficiency was
   rather low (synthetic solution: 38.5-40.5% and mine water: 26.2-43.1%).

AB Highly selective and efficient removal of ionic pollutants, including
   ionic organic compounds and heavy metal ions from water, is still a huge
   challenge due to the complex nature of polluted water. To meet this
   challenge, we presented the synthesis of bifunctionalized
   polyethyleneimine-based sponges through cryo-polymerization via BDDE as
   the crosslinker followed by bifunctional modification with glycidyl
   trimethylammonium chloride (GTAC) and phenyl glycidyl ether (PGE), which
   simultaneously afford quaternary ammonium cation (strongly basic and
   hydrophilic) and phenyl (hydrophobic) functionalities, respectively. As
   a result, a hybrid hydrophilichydrophobic sponge is generated that could
   stably be suspended underwater due to the co-operative effect of the
   water-absorbing hydrophilic domain and the hydrophobic domain generating
   buoyancy. The quaternized and phenyl-functionalized PEI-based sponge
   (SQP-PEI) demonstrated highly selective and efficient removal of anionic
   pollutants from water, including diclofenac sodium (DIC), methyl orange
   (MO) and chromium (Cr(VI)) with coexisting interferences. The Langmuir
   isotherms revealed the maximum adsorption capacities of 342.7 mg/g,
   491.9 mg/g, and 242.7 mg/g for DIC, MO, and Cr(VI), respectively. The
   studies of adsorption mechanism suggested that the bifunctional SQP-PEI
   sponge indeed afford both strong anion-exchange interaction and ???
   interaction toward organic pollutants DIC and MO, and the strong
   anion-exchange interaction can be the dominated adsorption mechanism for
   anionic DIC, MO and Cr(VI) species. The suspended SQP-PEI also
   demonstrated excellent reusability, which shows the potential of SQP-PEI
   for real applications.

AB Congo red (CR) is a hazardous pigment, posing increasing dangerous to
   the environment and human health. However, the in-situ detection of CR
   in living cells has not been reported, as far as we know. Here,
   negatively-charged green-emitting Ca, N, S-doped carbon dots
   (Mis-mPD-CDs) were fabricated from plant and m-phenylenediamine (mPD) by
   facile one-step hydrothermal carbonization. Mis-mPD-CDs were capable of
   rapidly detecting CR on the basis of their fluorescence quenching by CR
   due to the in-ner filter effect. This CR detection based on Mis-mPD-CDs
   displayed a linear range of 0.2-1.2 mu M and a low limit of detection
   (58 nM), and was not interfered by metal ions, important biological
   molecules, and other dyes, showing high sensitivity and selectivity.
   More interestingly, Mis-mPD-CDs can rapidly enter and label animal cells
   (A549, 4T1, and HUVEC), fungi (S. cerevisiae, C. albicans, and T.
   reesei), and bacteria (E. coli and S. aureus) for long term with high
   stability and appealing biocompatibility. Based on these compelling
   characteristics, we applied Mis-mPD-CDs for sensing and imaging CR in
   living cells (A549, C. albicans, E. coli, and S. aureus) and zebra fish.
   On the other hand, the quantitative detection of CR by Mis-mPD-CDs was
   realized in real samples like fish tissues and industrial wastewater.
   This is the first report on applying CDs for rapid CR detection in
   living cells and in vivo. Mis-mPD-CDs provides a novel efficient
   platform for probing intracellular CR, expanding the applications of CDs
   as biosensors for toxic dyes.

AB A facile soft-template solvent thermal strategy was developed to prepare
   mesoporous carbon-silica composite (MMCS) by using furfuryl alcohol (FA)
   as carbon precursor, Pluronic copolymer P123 as template, hydrated iron
   nitrate as iron source, and teraethylorthosilicate as silicon source and
   it was applied for the removal of methyl orange (MO). The as-synthesized
   MMCS with abound of hydrophilic groups processed a high specific surface
   area, large pore volume, and good magnetic response. With the increased
   amount of FA, the surface area and functional groups increased,
   promoting the adsorption effect. The maximum adsorption capacity of MO
   on MMCS can be high to 113.1 mg g(-1) at pH 4 with 150 mg L-1 initial MO
   concentration. The adsorption isotherm, kinetic, and thermodynamics were
   all studied and the results showed the adsorption process well fitted
   Langmuir adsorption isotherm and pseudo-second-order model.
   Additionally, it was shown that the adsorption process could not be
   interfered by the co-existence of PO43-, NO3-, CO32-, SO42-, and real
   water matrix. And the proposed adsorbent can remove MO in three
   practical water samples with satisfied removal rates ranging from 92.8
   to 99.8%. Thus, the MMCS prepared in this study could be utilized as an
   alternative adsorbent for the removal of methyl orange from practical
   aqueous solution.

AB An approach that can recuperate of energy from wastewater treatment
   process is highly necessitate and would help to surmount the both
   environmental pollution and energy crisis issues. A photocatalytic fuel
   cell (PFC) employing an anodic TiO2/ZnO/Zn and a cathodic CuO/Cu has
   been applied to degrade the raw greywater, which realized advanced
   organics destruction, bacteria disinfection, and synchronously
   electricity production. The improved photocatalytic performance has been
   observed when the cell was incorporated with anodic TiO2/ZnO/Zn under UV
   and sunlight irradiation due to the enhanced electric field conductivity
   of the catalysts and heterojunction interface of TiO2. In the
   constructed UV-activated PFC system, the electricity production
   capability was observed with the measured voltage and power density of
   868 mV and 0.0172 mW cm(-2), respectively. Advanced chemical oxygen
   demand (COD) removal efficiency of greywater achieved a 100% completion
   within 60 min of light irradiation. The Eischerichia coli (E. coli)
   colonies decreased significantly and accounted similar to 99%
   disinfection efficiency. Moreover, the photoelectrochemical and
   photoluminescence (PL) experiments elucidated that the charge carrier
   separation efficiency were higher when TiO2 was coupled to ZnO. The
   organic matter elimination principle was assessed by radical trapping
   experiment, and the findings indicated that the hydroxyl (center dot OH)
   radical and hole (h(+)) appeared as major functions in the reaction. The
   stable cycle operation of the cell has been also obtained owing to the
   stable and film-type materials of anodic material. This performance was
   among the highest documented for PFC using real wastewater effluent as
   the fuel source. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Urbanization and industrialization have resulted in the escalation of
   the occurrence of emerging contaminants (EC) in the wastewater and
   ultimately to the receiving water bodies due to their bio-refractory
   nature. The presence of ECs in the water bodies adversely affects all
   three domains of life, viz. bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes, and
   eventually the ecosystem. Fenton oxidation is one of the most suitable
   method that is capable of degrading a variety of ECs by employing a
   strong oxidizing agent in the form of center dot OH. The coupling of
   Fenton oxidation with microbial fuel cell (MFC) offers benefits, such as
   low-cost, minimal requirement of external energy, and in-situ generation
   of oxidizing agents. The resulting system, termed as bio-electro-Fenton
   MFC (BEF-MFC), is capable of degrading the ECs in the cathodic chamber,
   while harvesting bioelectricity and simultaneously removing oxidizable
   organic matter from wastewater in the anodic chamber. This review
   discusses the applications of BEF-MFC for the treatment of dyes,
   pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and real complex wastewaters. Additionally,
   the effect of operating conditions on the performance of BEF-MFC are
   elaborated and emphasis is also given on possible future direction of
   research that can be adopted in BEF-MFC in the purview of up-scaling.

AB The peroxydisulfate (PDS) -based advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) is
   a promising technology for wastewater treatment and the efficiency
   primarily depends on the high-performance catalysts. Therefore, it is
   necessary to develop a green and low-cost biomaterial for PDS activation
   to drive such a process. In this study, biochar catalysts were produced
   via pyrolysis of anaerobic digestion sludge (ADS) as effective PDS
   activators. The biochar derived from ADS (ADSBC) yielded large specific
   surface areas, a high degree of graphitization and good conductivity,
   which can be used for effectively oxidizing various pollutants including
   dyes, estrogens and sulfonamides with PDS in broad pH and temperature
   ranges. It is showed that PDS activated by ADSBC 1000 can completely
   remove sulfathiazole in 90 min much higher than that of ADSBC 400
   (20.25%). Moreover, the biochar produced under high pyrolysis
   temperature shows great stability and low biotoxicity due to the limited
   metals leaching and eliminated persistent free radicals as well as
   dissolved organic matter. The mechanism of the ADSBCs/PDS system was
   critically discussed via selectively radical screening tests, solvent
   exchange (H2O to D2O), selectivity to pollutants and electrochemical
   analysis. These results revealed that the organics were decomposed by a
   nonradical pathway via electron transfer rather than relying on free
   radicals or singlet oxygen. More importantly, the biochar-based
   nonradical oxidation system can leveraged for inactivation of
   Escherichia coli (E. coli) and diverse bacteria in both simulated and
   real wastewater. Therefore, this work not only provides an approach to
   reuse the sludge residue to prepare graphitic biochar catalysts as PDS
   activators for decontamination of emerging micropollutants, but also
   expands the practical application of advanced carbocatalysis for
   bacteria inactivation by nonradical oxidation in real wastewater.

AB The removal of toxic metals from the aquatic ecosystem is one of the
   most pressing environmental and public health concerns today. A strong
   potential has recently emerged for the removal of such metals using
   biochar sorbents. Biosorption technology could make a significant
   difference in the future. It is a viable and cost-effective alternative
   to the remediation of toxic pollutants utilizing various biomaterials.
   In the current study, batch and fixed-bed studies were performed to
   evaluate the performance of Capsicum annuum L. seeds biochar (CASB) as
   an alternative material in removing toxic Pb(II) from aqueous solutions.
   Removal characteristics were investigated by considering the equilibrium
   and kinetic aspects. Biosorption equilibrium was established within 40
   min. The optimum dosage of CASB for Pb(II) removal was determined as 2.0
   g L-1. Biosorption data were well predicted by a non-linear Langmuir
   isotherm model. Monolayer biosorption occurred for CASB with a maximum
   capacity of 36.43 mg g-1. Biosorption kinetics fitted well with a
   pseudo-first-order kinetic model. The external mass transfer may control
   Pb(II) transport mechanism. Dynamic flow mode biosorption and
   regeneration potential of CASB were also examined. The application of
   CASB exhibited a 100% removal yield in real apple juice samples spiked
   with low concentrations of Pb(II). Exhausted points for the CASB packed
   columns were recorded as 195 and 320 min for simulated wastewater (SW)
   and synthetic Pb(II) solution, respectively. FTIR, BET, SEM-EDX
   analysis, and zeta potential measurements were used for the
   characterization of biochar and assessment of the metal ion-biosorbent
   interaction mechanism. Finally, our study provides a practical approach
   for the uptake of Pb(II) ions from contaminated solutions.

AB Although photocatalytic concrete can significantly contribute to the
   degradation of air pollutants and improving the sustainability levels,
   the complexity of ordinary cement system often caused the uncertain
   performance of mixed photocatalysts, which limited the real application
   of photocatalysts. Since the rapid carbonization hardening and
   relatively simple composition, gamma-C2S carbonated binding material has
   gained considerable attention for its application in construction
   material. In this work, quartz sand-supported TiO2-C2S(gamma) composites
   (TQSC) were prepared by mixing photocatalytic quartz sand with gamma-C2S
   and mounting in gamma-C2S matrix surface methods. The TiO2-coated quartz
   sand (TQS) was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), quantitative
   X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The
   photocatalytic performance and durability (washing resistance) of TQSC
   were also investigated by the degradation ability of NOx and rhodamine B
   (RhB). The results show that a uniform TiO2 layer on quartz sand was
   prepared, and the photocatalytic De-NOx (degradation of NOx) performance
   increased with increasing the mounted amounts of TiO2/quartz sand in
   gamma-C2S carbonated matrix surface, but would decrease the
   photocatalytic durability. After water-washing, the De-NOx efficiencies
   of TQSC specimens decreased quickly at the beginning, which were
   adhering to the mounted amounts of TiO2/quartz sand, but would become
   stable after water-washing for 3600 s for all samples. The relatively
   high De-NOx stability and good self-cleaning effect of the water-washed
   TQSC-60% specimen can be considered a promising photocatalytic product
   for real applications.

AB In biosorption research, a fairly broad range of mathematical models are
   used to correlate discrete data points obtained from batch equilibrium,
   batch kinetic or fixed bed breakthrough experiments. Most of these
   models are inherently nonlinear in their parameters. Some of the models
   have enjoyed widespread use, largely because they can be linearized to
   allow the estimation of parameters by least- squares linear regression.
   Selecting a model for data correlation appears to be dictated by the
   ease with which it can be linearized and not by other more important
   criteria such as parameter accuracy or theoretical relevance. As a
   result, models that cannot be linearized have enjoyed far less
   recognition because it is necessary to use a search algorithm for
   parameter estimation. In this study a real- coded genetic algorithm is
   applied as the search method to estimate equilibrium isotherm and
   kinetic parameters for batch biosorption as well as breakthrough
   parameters for fixed bed biosorption. The genetic algorithm is found to
   be a useful optimization tool, capable of accurately finding optimal
   parameter estimates. Its performance is compared with that of nonlinear
   and linear regression methods.

AB In this study, tin oxide-cobalt oxide nanocatalyst was prepared by a
   simple method, which grew in spherical particles with an average
   diameter of 30 nm. Tin oxide-cobalt oxide was further wrapped in
   alginate polymer hydrogel (Alg@tin oxide-cobalt oxide), and both
   materials were utilized as nanocatalysts for the catalytic
   transformation of different pollutants. Tin oxide-cobalt oxide and
   Alg@tin oxide-cobalt oxide nanocatalysts were tested for the catalytic
   reduction of 4-nitrophenol, congo red, methyl orange, methylene blue
   (MB) and potassium ferricyanide in which sodium borohydride was used as
   a reducing agent. Tin oxide-cobalt oxide and Alg@tin oxide-cobalt oxide
   nanocatalysts synergistically reduced MB in shorter time (2.0 and 4.0
   min) compared to other dyes. The reduction conditions were optimized by
   changing different parameters. The rate constants for MB reduction were
   calculated and found to be 1.5714 min-1 and 0.6033 min-1 using tin
   oxide-cobalt oxide and Alg@tin oxide-cobalt oxide nanocatalysts,
   respectively. Implementing Alg@tin oxide-cobalt oxide nanocatalyst
   toward MB reduction in real samples proved its efficacy in sea and well
   water samples. The catalyst could be easily recovered, recycled and
   revealed a minimal loss of nanoparticles, which offering a competition
   and replacement with reputable commercial catalysts.

AB Arsenic (As) contamination in drinking water has grown into a global
   concern in recent years, which demands the development of various As
   remediation approaches. In this study, a new magnetic nanocomposite,
   carrageenan-embedded LaFeO3 nanoparticles (abbreviated as CA-LaFeNPs)
   was synthesized by a sol-gel process and used to remove arsenite
   [As(iii)] from water. The synthesized magnetic adsorbent was
   characterized by powder XRD, SEM, FTIR, VSM, and TGA. The adsorbent gel,
   CA-LaFeNP was mainly with LaFeO3 in nanoscale particles with a
   saturation magnetization of 13.33 emu g(-1) and could be easily
   separated from water with a simple hand-held magnet in 2 minutes. The
   adsorption outcomes of the CA-LaFeNPs could be finely interpreted by
   Langmuir, Freundlich, and Tempkin isotherm models. The Langmuir isotherm
   model appears to have good regression coefficients, and maximum
   adsorption capacity was estimated to be 91 mg g(-1) for CA-LaFeNPs at 27
   degrees C and pH 7. The removal efficiency observed for CA-FeNPs was 91%
   up to the As(iii) concentration of 700 mg L-1, while it decreased to 85%
   when the As(iii) concentration was above 1200 mg L-1. This low-cost and
   environmentally-friendly magnetic nanocomposite, CA-LaFeNPs could be
   more appropriate for real-world applications and also a substitute for
   the traditional magnetic nanoparticles.

AB Suspended matter and organic contaminants would prevent short-wavelength
   UV/visible light from penetrating deeper into real wastewater. This has
   hindered the practical use of photocatalysts in wastewater remediation.
   Construction of near-infrared light responsive photocatalysts can
   partially overcome this issue, due to the larger penetration depth of
   near-infrared light into the waste media. However, the development of
   near-infrared responsive photocatalysts is constrained by low
   photoconversion efficiency. In this work, we developed an approach to
   enhance the performance of NIRresponsive photocatalysis of a
   lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticle-TiO2 hybrid system through
   coupling the surface adhesion capability of heavy lanthanides with a NIR
   to UV/vis light upconversion process. We demonstrated that a Gd3+-rich
   nanoparticle surface can enhance the adhesion of organic compounds on
   the heterogeneous catalysts, resulting in more complete cycloreversion
   of organic chromophores. We systematically investigated the
   photooxidation pathways of the upconversion nanoparticle-TiO2 hybrid
   catalysts in degradation of rhodamine B through liquid
   chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. The results reveal that Gd3+
   ions on the catalyst surface could facilitate the complete
   mineralization of the organic molecules to achieve a total organic
   carbon removal efficiency of around 70%, which is three times higher
   than that of the conventional upconversion nanoparticle-TiO2 systems.
   The results offer new opportunities for near-infrared light driven
   photocatalysis in water remediation, which is potentially applicable for
   large quantity deep wastewater treatment.

AB An effective and sustainable biosorbent (MagOPIC) was prepared from
   chitosan and olive pomace by the combined action of immobilization and
   magnetic modification to remediate Pb2+-contaminated waters. Pb2+
   sorption yield at the end of the equilibrium (45 min) period was
   estimated to be 98.56 +/- 0.28% at pH 5.5. Agitation speed, ionic
   strength, and temperature did not significantly affect the Pb2+
   biosorption. Biosorption kinetics are successfully fitted by the
   pseudo-second-order equation while the equilibrium biosorption data are
   properly modeled using the Freundlich and D-R isotherms. MagOPIC has
   also exhibited a high biosorption yield in the column tests (>= 99%) and
   showed remarkable stability up to twenty consecutive regeneration
   cycles. Furthermore, it was successfully used for the treatment of Pb2+
   containing real wastewater. The findings of this work highlighted the
   potential use of MagOPIC as a novel, cost-effective and eco-friendly
   biosorbent for the Pb2+ removal from the contaminated aquatic phase.

AB Arsenic in groundwater is a serious environmental problem. The
   contamination of groundwater with arsenic has been of utmost concern
   worldwide. Steel slag is a solid waste generated from steel production.
   Although steel slags have been used for arsenic removal from water, this
   process has not been systematically or integratively researched. In this
   study, the arsenic removal capacity and mechanism were investigated for
   carbon steel slag, stainless steel slag and Fe-modified stainless steel
   slag based on an in-depth study. The study also evaluated the potential
   utilization of different steel slag for regeneration. The maximum
   adsorption of arsenic on carbon steel slag, stainless steel slag and
   Fe-modified stainless steel slag was 12.20, 3.17 and 12.82 mg g(-1) at
   25 degrees C, respectively. The modification of stainless steel slag by
   FeCl3 can generate more pore structures and larger surface areas, and
   300 degrees C treatment produces the best regeneration efficiency. The
   Delta G values were negative for all of the steel slags, indicating the
   spontaneous nature of the adsorption process. The solution pH was a
   critical parameter for the removal of arsenic for steel slags. Under
   highly alkaline solution conditions, the mechanism of arsenic removal by
   carbon steel slag and stainless steel slag can be attributed to
   chemisorption, including chemical precipitation and coordination
   reactions, and under weakly alkaline solution conditions, electrostatic
   interaction and specific adsorption are the arsenic removal mechanisms
   by Fe-modified stainless steel slag. Regeneration of the Fe-modified
   stainless steel slag was better achieved than that of the other steel
   slags in the application of high-temperature treatment.

   anchored to benzaldehyde ligand through polymeric bonding and studied as

   characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR),
   Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM) equipped with EDS,
   X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Vibrating Sample Magnetometry (VSM), thermal
   gravimetric analysis (TGA). Based on the obtained analysis results
   synthesized average nanocomposite diameter is 25-55 nm. In batch
   experiments, operative parameters in adsorption process like pH, sorbent
   dosage, contact time and initial concentration of NAP have investigated,
   and maximum adsorption for NAP by sorbent in optimal adsorption
   conditions examined. Therefore, synthesized nanocomposite used for
   removing NAP from real water samples and industrial wastewater
   containing complex matrices and all of them analyzed by Gas
   Chromatography-Mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The NAP removal efficiency of
   93-100% obtained from water in the river, sea and industrial waste.
   Also, fitting the adsorption process with various isotherm models and
   kinetic studies designated that the equilibrium data follow from the
   Langmuir model (R-2 = 0.9957) and adsorption kinetic from the
   pseudo-second-order model (R-2 = 0.9999). Maximum adsorption capacity
   for sorbent was q(max) = 101 mg g(-1). As a result, synthesized magnetic
   dendrimers have high adsorption capacity without no environmental pH
   adjustment which is recyclable for four-times as an efficient sorbent
   used for removing NAP from aqueous solutions.

AB 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone-5-sulfonic acid with a trade name of
   benzophenone-4, a typical anti-UV product, is increasingly detected in
   real aqueous environment. Few literature using cost-effective adsorption
   means with enough high adsorption capacity for the removal of
   benzophenone-4 is available. In this work, a series of novel tertiary
   amine-functionalized crosslinking polymeric resins, synthesized using
   different proportions of raw materials including 2-dimethylamino ethyl
   methacrylate as the monomer, divinylbenzene as the crosslinking reagent
   and toluene as the pore-forming reagent, were employed for the
   adsorption of benzophenone-4. During the synthesis process, an
   environmental friendly one-step fabrication method, following the
   concept of cleaner production, was established for the reduction of
   unnecessary derivatization steps, extra pollution risk, costs and time.
   Among these resins, the optimal one with relatively larger pore
   diameter, larger specific surface area, and fewer inner defects,
   exhibited the highest adsorption capacity of 154 mg/g. Such a value was
   notably larger than several frequently reported commercial adsorbents,
   including activated carbon, ion exchange resins and macroporous resins.
   The performance of the resin not only owned strong resistance against
   influences of coexisting natural organic matter and inorganic ions, but
   also bore reuse without much capacity loss after six
   adsorption-desorption cycles. Adsorption interfacial interactions were
   studied, via both experimental analyses and chemical calculations.
   Electrostatic attraction between tertiary amine of the resin and -SO3-
   of benzophenone-4 played a leading role during adsorption. (C) 2018

AB A highly effective naphthalene-degrading bacterial strain was isolated
   from acclimated activated sludge from a coal gasification wastewater
   plant, and identified as a Streptomyces sp., designated as strain
   QWE-35. The optimal pH and temperature for naphthalene degradation were
   7.0 and 35A degrees C. The presence of additional glucose and methanol
   significantly increased the degradation efficiency of naphthalene. The
   strain showed tolerance to the toxicity of naphthalene at a
   concentration as great as 200 mg/L. The Andrews mode could be fitted to
   the degradation kinetics data well over a wide range of initial
   naphthalene concentrations (10-200 mg/L), with kinetic values q (max) =
   0.84 h(-1), K (s) = 40.39 mg/L, and K (i) = 193.76 mg/L. Metabolic
   intermediates were identified by gas chromatography and mass
   spectrometry, allowing a new degradation pathway for naphthalene to be
   proposed for the first time. Strain QWE-35 was added into a membrane
   bioreactor (MBR) to enhance the treatment of real coal gasification
   wastewater. The results showed that the removal of chemical oxygen
   demand and total nitrogen were similar between bioaugmented and
   non-bioaugmented MBRs, however, significant removal of naphthalene was
   obtained in the bioaugmented reactor. The findings suggest a potential
   bioremediation role of Streptomyces sp. QWE-35 in the removal of
   naphthalene from wastewaters.

AB Individual and competitive adsorption studies were carried out to
   investigate the removal of phenol and nickel ions by adsorption onto
   multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The carbon nanotubes were
   characterized by different techniques such as X-ray diffraction,
   scanning electron microscopy, thermal analysis and Fourier
   transformation infrared spectroscopy. The different experimental
   conditions affecting the adsorption process were investigated. Kinetics
   and equilibrium models were tested for fitting the adsorption
   experimental data. The characterization experimental results proved that
   the studied adsorbent possess different surface functional groups as
   well as typical morphological features. The batch experiments revealed
   that 300 min of contact time was enough to achieve equilibrium for the
   adsorption of both phenol and nickel at an initial adsorbate
   concentration of 25 mg/l, an adsorbent dosage of 5 g/l, and a solution
   pH of 7. The adsorption of phenol and nickel by MWCNTs followed the
   pseudo-second order kinetic model and the intraparticle diffusion model
   was quite good in describing the adsorption mechanism. The Langmuir
   equilibrium model fitted well the experimental data indicating the
   homogeneity of the adsorbent surface sites. The maximum Langmuir
   adsorption capacities were found to be 32.23 and 6.09 mg/g, for phenol
   and Ni ions, respectively. The removal efficiency of MWCNTs for nickel
   ions or phenol in real wastewater samples at the optimum conditions
   reached up to 60% and 70%, respectively. (C) 2014 Production and hosting

AB Chili seeds (CS) represent one of the most abundant residues in Mexico
   due to the high production and consumption. In this work, CS were used
   as raw material for the production of low-cost adsorbents for the
   removal of methylene blue from water. The adsorbents were synthesized
   from a hydrothermal treatment (based on a surface response experiment
   design) and characterized texturally by assessing changes in their
   properties. The mass yield (%R), carbon content (%C), and the second
   order adsorption rate constant (k(2)) were derived in relation to a list
   of input variables (e.g., the reaction temperature, residence time, and
   water/biomass ratio). Accordingly, those output variables were affected
   most sensitively by temperature and/or residence time, while changes of
   the water/biomass ratio were insignificant. Besides, an increase in the
   reaction temperature favored the degradation of the lignocellulosic
   material with increases in the carbon fixation. The adsorption capacity
   of methylene blue (MB) by the hydrochars depended drastically on the
   oxygen/carbon ratio. As such, the maximum adsorption capacity value of
   145 mg g(-1) was attained at the initial MB concentration of similar to
   3000 mu M (optimal oxygen/carbon value of 0.43). On the other hand, the
   maximum partition coefficient (K-D) was estimated as 2.96 mu M-1 mg
   g(-1) with the initial/equilibrium concentrations of 20.5/6.93 mu M. The

AB A portable OH radical scavenging demand analyzer that can be installed
   and operated on site was developed to measure water quality indicators
   that influence the generation of OH radicals from UV/hydrogen peroxide
   reactions to determine the UV dose and the hydrogen peroxide injection
   concentration. Rhodamine B (RhB) was used as an indicator for the
   continuous measurement of the OH radical scavenging demand of four
   samples with different water quality parameters using the rapid, easy,
   and real-time UV-Vis spectrophotometer method. The results demonstrated
   that the estimated rate constant for the RhB color decay rate resulting
   from direct UV photolysis was low enough to verify its suitability as a
   probe compound. The mean values of the OH radical scavenging demand for
   target water samples at different organic concentrations were 20,659
   s(-1) for plant N, 42,346 s(-1) for plant C, 32,232 s(-1) for plant Y,
   and 81,669 s(-1) for plant B. Variations in the monitoring results for
   the target water treatment plants suggest that on-site OH radical
   scavenging demands should be considered to determine the UV dose and the
   hydrogen peroxide injection concentration for the UV advanced oxidation
   process.

AB The oil-produced water generated during drilling of oil wells and gas
   extraction has been a cause for great concern since it contains a
   complexmixture of different organic and inorganic compounds, large
   amount of CO2, grease, salts, minerals, oils, and many hazardous
   compounds. The present work investigates the efficiency of
   photocatalysis (PC), photoelectrocatalysis (PEC), ozonation (O-3), and
   photoelectrocatalysis coupled with ozonation (PEC+O-3) in the removal of
   organic and inorganic contaminants in the oil-produced water monitored
   by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) and Ionic Chromatography
   (IC) techniques. Parameters such as toxicity, which was investigated
   using Zebrafish embryos, color, turbidity, pH, quantity of dissolved
   solids, conductivity, chemical oxygen demand (COD), and concentrations
   of organic and inorganic carbon were also investigated. The best results
   were obtained by coupling PEC and O-3 techniques, which presented
   superior reduction in color (98%), turbidity (100%), inorganic carbon
   (99%), COD (73%), and a decrease of 96% in the fluoride and 35% in the
   chloride detected previously in the real oil-produced water. Among the
   12 organic compounds identified in the oil-produced water, the PEC+O-3
   treatment reached complete oxidation in eight of them and a lower
   Zebrafish embryo mortality occurred with 12.5% of dilution after 2 h
   treatment. (C) The Author(s) 2019. Published by ECS.

AB In the present work, a new component parabolic collector (CPC) was
   introduced as a solar photocatalytic reactor and applied in pilot-scale
   for degradation of Phenazopyridine (PhP) via a Solar/H2O2/S2O82-/TiO2
   process. The TiO2 nanoparticles were immobilized on the outer surface of
   CPC receivers' tubes by physicochemical processes. Field emission
   scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was demonstrated a favorable
   attachment of nanoparticles on the glass tubes. Low Ti leaching during
   repeated experiments was approved by inductively coupled plasma (ICP)
   analysis. The final degrading by-products of PhP were identified and
   analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) analysis.
   Moreover, the impact of the effective parameters on the degradation of
   PhP during dual oxidation process in a solar-driven photocatalytic
   reactor such as flow rate, oxidant, PhP concentration, and pH was
   investigated and simulated with Artificial Neural Network (ANN) analysis
   and optimized with Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Ant Colony Algorithm
   (ACA). Consequently, the toxicity of effluent was tested with plants in
   optimal conditions when the oxidation step proceeded. This report
   summarized the current status of solar photocatalysis favorable
   photocatalytic activity under solar light irradiation enhanced with CPC
   photoreactor which was successfully prepared. Guided by studies to
   explore the determination of optimal conditions for disinfection of real
   municipal wastewater, the biological treatment was investigated. In
   addition, the antibacterial assessment was considered to determine the
   presence of bacteria after solar disinfection. (C) 2022 Published by

AB This study presents a screening protocol to evaluate the applicability
   of the ZVI pretreatment to various industrial wastewaters of which major
   constituents are not identified. The screening protocol consisted of a
   sequential analysis of UV-vis spectrophotometry, high-performance liquid
   chromatograph (HPLC), and bioassay. The UV-vis and HPLC analyses
   represented the potential reductive transformation of unknown
   constituents in wastewater by the ZVI. The UV-vis and HPLC results were
   quantified using principal component analysis (PCA) and Euclidian
   distance (ED). The short-term bioassay was used to assess the increased
   biodegradability of wastewater constituents after ZVI treatment. The
   screening protocol was applied to seven different types of real
   industrial wastewaters. After identifying one wastewater as the best
   candidate for the ZVI treatment, the benefit of ZVI pretreatment was
   verified through continuous operation of an integrated iron-sequencing
   batch reactor (SBR) resulting in the increased organic removal
   efficiency compared to the control. The iron pretreatment was suggested
   as an economical option to modify some costly physico-chemical processes
   in the existing wastewater treatment facility. The screening protocol
   could be used as a robust strategy to estimate the applicability of ZVI
   pretreatment to a certain wastewater with unknown composition. (C) 2010

AB To improve the performance of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), a hotly
   researched metal-free photocatalyst, for better application in the
   efficient removal of organic pollutants, adsorption synergistically
   enhanced photocatalysis mechanism was thoroughly explored. Based on KOH
   pore-forming activated biochar (ACB) and K+ doped g-C3N4 (K-gC(3)N(4)),
   the novel activated biochar-based K-gC(3)N(4) composite
   (ACB-K-gC(3)N(4)) was synthesized via the innovative ultrasonic-milling
   method. Rhodamine B (RhB), tetracycline (TC), norfloxacin (NOR), and
   chloramphenicol (CAP) were selected as target pollutants, and the
   effects of environmental factors, recycling and actual wastewater tests,
   disinfection effects, and various enhancement strategies were
   investigated. The results showed that K-gC(3)N(4) was successfully
   composited with ACB by various characterizations, where the loading mass
   ratio of 1:2 exhibited the best performance. ACB-K-gC(3)N(4) possessed a
   larger specific surface area, richer functional groups, suitable band
   gap (2.29 eV), and broader visible light absorption (~716 nm) than
   K-gC(3)N(4). ACB-K-gC(3)N(4) presented effective removal efficiency over
   K-gC(3)N(4) for four pollutants, in which the removal efficiency of RhB
   reached 93.26%, and the degradation rate constant of 0.0119 min(-1) was
   four times higher than K-gC(3)N(4) (0.0029 min(-1)). Moreover,
   ACB-K-gC(3)N(4) was superior to K-gC(3)N(4) in disinfecting S. aureus
   and E. coli, with a sterilization rate of exceeding 90% for 12 h. The
   photodegradation activity was dominated by <bold>center
   dot</bold>O-2(-), h(+), and <bold>middot</bold>OH, and the mechanisms
   involved in the three stages. This was attributed to the unique
   structure and surface properties (defects and persistent free radicals)
   of ACB, as evidenced by improved adsorption stage and transfer of
   degradation intermediates, facilitated the generation of active species,
   accelerated migration of photogenerated electrons, and inhibited
   photogenerated carriers recombination by the heterojunction. The good
   reusability and stability, enhancement strategies (blowing air and
   heating), and satisfactory feasibility for actual wastewater allow
   ACB-K-gC(3)N(4) possible to promote high-concentration wastewater
   treatment and disinfection.

AB Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a sustainable wastewater treatment
   technology which facilitates energy, nutrient, and water recovery from
   organic wastes. The agricultural and industrial wastes are suitable
   substrates for the AD, as they contain a high level of biodegradable
   compounds. The aim of this study was to examine the AD of three
   different concentrations of phenol (100, 200, and 300 mg/L) containing
   wastewater with and without co-substrate (acetate) at four different
   temperatures (25, 35, 45, and 55 degrees C) to produce methane
   (CH4)-enriched biogas. It was observed that the chemical oxygen demand
   (COD) and phenol removal efficiencies of up to 76% and 72%,
   respectively, were achieved. The CH4 generation was found higher in
   anaerobic batch reactors (ABRs) using acetate as co-substrate, with the
   highest yield of 189.1 mu L CH4 from 500 mu L sample injected, obtained
   using 200 mg/L of phenol at 35 degrees C. The results revealed that the
   performance of ABR in terms of degradation efficiency, COD removal, and
   biogas generation was highest at 35 degrees C followed by 55, 45, and 25
   degrees C indicating 35 degrees C to be the optimum temperature for AD
   of phenolic wastewater with maximum energy recovery. Scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) revealed that the morphology of the anaerobic sludge
   depends greatly on the temperature at which the system is maintained
   which in turn affects the performance and degradation of toxic
   contaminants like phenol. It was observed that the anaerobic sludge
   maintained at 35 degrees C showed uniform channels leading to higher
   permeability through enhanced mass transfer to achieve higher
   degradation rates. However, the denser sludge as in the case of 55
   degrees C showed lesser permeability leading to limited transfer and
   thus reduced treatment. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis
   revealed a more noteworthy change in the population of the microbial
   communities due to temperature than the presence of phenol with the
   methanogens being the dominating species at 35 degrees C. The findings
   suggest that the planned operation of the ABR could be a promising
   choice for CH4-enriched biogas and COD removal from phenolic wastewater.

AB Prednisolone is a widely prescribed synthetic glucocorticoid and stated
   to be toxic to a number of non-target aquatic organisms. Its extensive
   consumption generates environmental concern due to its detection in
   wastewater samples at concentrations ranged from ng/L to g/L that
   requests the application of suitable degradation processes. Regarding
   the actual treatment options, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are
   presented as a viable alternative. In this work, the comparison in terms
   of pollutant removal and energetic efficiencies, between different AOPs
   such as Fenton (F), photo-Fenton (UV/F), photolysis (UV), and hydrogen
   peroxide/photolysis (UV/H2O2), was carried out. Light diode emission
   (LED) was the selected source to provide the UV radiation. The UV/F
   process revealed the best performance, reaching high levels of both
   degradation and mineralization with low energy consumption. Its
   optimization was conducted and the operational parameters were iron and
   H2O2 concentrations and the working volume. Using the response surface
   methodology with the Box-Behnken design, the effect of independent
   variables and their interactions on the process response were
   effectively evaluated. Different responses were analyzed taking into
   account the prednisolone removal (TOC and drug abatements) and the
   energy consumptions associated. The obtained model showed an improvement
   of the UV/F process when treating smaller volumes and when adding high
   concentrations of H2O2 and Fe2+. The validation of this model was
   successfully carried out, having only 5% of discrepancy between the
   model and the experimental results. Finally, the performance of the
   process when having a real wastewater matrix was also tested, achieving
   complete mineralization and detoxification after 8h. In addition,
   prednisolone degradation products were identified. Finally, the obtained
   low energy permitted to confirm the viability of the process.

AB FeVO4/CeO2 was applied in the electro-Fenton (EF) degradation of Methyl
   Orange (MO) as a model of wastewater pollution. The results of the
   characterization techniques indicate that FeVO4 with triclinic structure
   and face-centered cubic fluorite CeO2 maintained their structures during
   the nanocomposite synthesis. The effect of applied current intensity,
   initial pollutant concentration, initial pH, and catalyst weight was
   investigated. The MO removal reached 96.31% and chemical oxygen demand
   (COD) removal 70% for 60 min of the reaction. The presence of CeO2 in
   the nanocomposite plays a key role in H2O2 electro-generation as a
   significant factor in the electro-Fenton (EF) system. The metal leaching
   from FeVO4/CeO2 was negligible (cerium 4.1%, iron 4.3%, and vanadium
   1.7%), which indicates that the active species in the nanocomposite are
   strongly interacting with each other and are stable. The performance of
   the nanocatalyst in real wastewaters, salty, and binary systems was
   acceptable and the pollutions were removed efficiently. The synergistic
   effect between V, Fe, and Ce could be account as the reason for the
   respectable function of FeVO4/CeO2. The electron transfer proceeds via
   Haber-Weiss mechanism. A degradation pathway was proposed through
   by-products analysis using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)
   technique. The pseudo-first-order kinetic model described the obtained
   experimental results (R-2 = 0.9906). The electro-Fenton system
   efficiency was improved by adding persulfate. The nanocomposite
   preserved almost its efficiency after six cycles. The obtained results
   demonstrate that the synergistic catalyst (FeVO4/CeO2) has the
   capability to introduce as a promising replacement of conventional
   catalysts in the electro-Fenton processes with brilliant proficiency.

AB The bioadsorbent C1, which is a chitosan derivative prepared in a

   simultaneously. Here, for the first time the simultaneous adsorption of
   a cation and an anion was modeled using the Corsel model for kinetics
   and the Real Adsorbed Solution Theory model for equilibrium data. Batch
   studies of the adsorption of Cu(II) and Cr(VI) in single and binary
   aqueous solutions were performed as a function of initial solute
   concentration, contact time, and solution pH. The maximum adsorption
   capacities of C1 in single and binary aqueous solutions were 1.84 and
   1.13 mmol g(-1) for Cu(II) and 3.86 and 0.98 mmol g(-1) for Cr(VI),
   respectively. The reuse of C4 was investigated, with Cu(II) ions being
   almost completely desorbed and fully re-adsorbed. For Cr(VI), the
   desorption was incomplete resulting in a lower readsorption.
   Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was used for mapping the
   distributions of Cr(VI) and Cu(II) adsorbed on the C1 surface in single
   and binary adsorption systems. Isothermal titration calorimetry
   experiments were performed for Cr(VI) and Cu(II) adsorption in single
   solutions. The thermodynamic parameters of adsorption showed that the
   adsorption of both metal ions was enthalpically driven, but entropically

AB BACKGROUND: A novel hybrid material, chitosan-modified zeolite (Ch-Z),
   was synthesized for defluoridation. The structure was characterized by
   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric analysis
   (TGA).
   RESULTS: The maximum defluoridation capacity onto Ch-Z was 4.16 mg g(-1)
   from an initial fluoride concentration of 40 mg L-1, which was almost
   three times higher than that of unmodified zeolite. The adsorption
   kinetics of fluoride onto Ch-Z and zeolite followed pseudo-second-order
   and intra-particle diffusion models, respectively. Based on a nonlinear
   method, the adsorption of fluoride onto Ch-Z fitted the Freundlich and
   Redlich-Peterson isotherm models well. Various physicochemical
   parameters affecting the adsorption of fluoride onto Ch-Z were
   investigated. It was observed that the maximum uptake of fluoride
   occurred in a pH range 4.5-5.5.
   CONCLUSION: Although among various ions the presence of high
   concentration carbonate ions in aqueous solution had the greatest
   adverse impact on the adsorption of fluoride, Ch-Z can be successfully
   used for treatment of real water samples. (C) 2012 Society of Chemical

AB In this study, we have reported a novel wastewater treatment technique
   by phenol imprinted bacterial cellulose (BC-MIP) nanofibres with high
   specificity and adsorption capacity. N-methacryloyl-(L) phenylalanine
   methyl ester (MAPA) functional monomer was used to create specific
   binding sites for the template molecule phenol via electrostatic and
   hydrophobic interactions. BC-MIP nanofibres were synthesized by surface
   imprinting approach in the presence of different amounts of total
   monomer (% weight), monomer/template ratio and polymerization time.
   Then, the nanofibres were characterized by FTIR-ATR, surface area
   analysis (BET), elemental analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
   and contact angle measurements. Adsorption studies were performed with
   respect to pH, temperature and ionic strength, and the adsorption
   capacity was calculated by using the spectrophotometer. In order to
   desorb the adsorbed phenol from BC-MIP nanofibres, 0.1 M NaCl solution
   was used. Besides, BC-MIP nanofibres were applied to real wastewater
   samples from Ergene basin in Turkey. The suitable equilibrium isotherm
   was determined as Langmuir isotherm. To evaluate the selectivity of the
   BC-MIP nanofibres, similar molecules were utilized as competitor
   molecules, which were 2-chlorophenol, 4-chlorophenol and
   2,4-dichlorophenol. Electrostatic interactions were found to contribute
   to the generation of specific recognition binding sites. The results
   have shown that imprinting of phenol was achieved successfully with high
   adsorption capacity. The phenol removal efficiency was reported up to
   97%. BC-MIP nanofibres were used 10 times with a negligible decrease in
   adsorption capacity.

AB The need of clean water demands to design an efficient catalytic system
   with high effective and selective reduction of water pollutants. Here,
   we successfully prepared copper oxide-tin oxide (CuO-SnO2) nanomaterial
   and further wrapped in Na-alginate hydrogel (Alg/CuO-SnO2). CuO-SnO2 and
   Alg/CuO-SnO2 were character-ized by FESEM, EDS, FTIR-ATR, and XRD and
   tested for the reduction of water pollutants. The catalytic ability of
   CuO-SnO2 and Alg/CuO-SnO2 was examined for numerous pollutants like
   4-nitrophenol (4-NP), methyl orange (MO), congo red (CR), methylene blue
   (MB) and potassium ferricyanide (K-3[Fe(CN)(6)]) where the designed
   CuO-SnO2 and Alg/CuO-SnO2 nanocatalysts were most selective toward MB
   reduction. Further on optimization of catalyst amount, stability, and
   reducing agent amount, it was found that the increase of nanocatalyst
   amount and NaBH4 concentration increase the rate of MB reduction.
   CuO-SnO2 and Alg/CuO-SnO2 nanocatalysts reduced MB in 3.0 min with
   reaction rate constants (k(app)) of 1.2944 min(-1) and 1.2715 min(-1),
   respectively. Additionally, Alg/CuO-SnO2 nanocatalyst was easily
   recovered by simply pulling hydrogel after completion of reaction and
   reused four times with no loss in efficiency. Besides, Alg/CuO-SnO2
   nanocatalyst was further investigated in real samples like sea water,
   irrigation water, well water, university wastewater and found effective
   for MB reduction even in real samples.

AB This study analyzed the cost implications of using suitable technologies
   and the cost of inaction when addressing water pollution. This was
   achieved by developing three main models for the costs (model one) and
   benefits (model two and model three). The first model accounts for the
   operational costs of adopting suitable technologies, namely the use of
   diatomaceous earth for textile wastewater treatment. The second model
   analyzed the cost of inaction through analyzing the cost of treatment
   for water pollution-related diseases for the affected population. The
   occurrence and cost of treatment for three diseases, namely diarrhea,
   amoebiasis and bacterial infection, were used as indicators of water
   pollution in the area. The third model included the contingent valuation
   method (CVM) data on the willingness to pay for environmental
   restoration of the surveyed population. The benefit-cost ratio (BCR) of
   the resulting data from the three models were used to highlight the
   economic viability of the proposed project. A BCR of (0.67) for the cost
   of the proposed project versus the benefits of the project on human
   health using data from one hospital was obtained. There is a high
   possibility that the real BCR would increase if more data from other
   hospitals or other diseases were included. The results imply that the
   use of D.E can be considered a good candidate for treating wastewater.
   To thoroughly discuss the BCR of treating wastewater from one factory,
   the BCR of the proposed restoration project along River Sosiani, and the
   value of using DE as suitable technology, more studies are needed to
   evaluate the unaccounted costs and benefits for accurate economic
   estimations of the proposed project. The outcome of the study is a
   framework of numbers and figures that can be presented to decision
   makers and policy makers as critical information when making decisions.

AB Heavy metal ions (Ni2+, Zn2+, and Cr3+) can be effectively removed from
   real polynary metal ions-bearing electroplating wastewaters by a
   carbonation process, with similar to 99% of metal ions removed in most
   cases. The synchronous formation of layered double hydroxide (LDH)
   precipitates containing these metal ions was responsible for the
   self-purification of wastewaters. The constituents of formed polynary
   metals-LDHs mainly depended on the Ni2+:Zn2+:Cr3+ molar ratio in
   wastewaters. LDH was formed at pH of 6.0-8.0 when the Ni2+/Zn2+ molar
   ratio >= 1 where molar fraction of trivalent metal in the wastewaters
   was 0.2-0.4, otherwise ZnO, hydrozincite, or amorphous precipitate was
   observed. In the case of LDH formation, the residual concentration of
   Ni2+, Zn2+, and Cr3+ in the treated wastewaters was very low, about 2-3,
   similar to 2, and similar to 1 mg/L, respectively, at 20-80 degrees C
   and pH of 6.0-8.0, indicating the effective incorporation of heavy metal
   ions into the LDH matrix. Furthermore, the obtained LDH materials were
   used to adsorb azoic dye GR, with the maximum adsorption amount of
   129-134 mg/g. We also found that the obtained LDHs catalyzed more than
   65% toluene to decompose at 350 degrees C under ambient pressure. Thus
   the current research has not only shown effective recovery of heavy
   metal ions from the electroplating wastewaters in an environmentally
   friendly process but also demonstrated the potential utilization of
   recovered materials.

   ability of a new niobium oxide nanocomposite under UV light irradiation
   for destruction of organic contaminants in water. The surface area, pore
   size, crystal structure, and morphology of the synthesized catalyst were
   characterized by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), X-ray diffraction (XRD),
   UV-vis spectrophotometry, and scanning and transmission electron
   microscopy (SEM & TEM). Porous photocatalytic materials can have the
   combined qualities of high surface area and relatively large particle
   sizes, as compared with nanoparticulate catalyst powders. The new
   materials have very large open pore structures that facilitate the
   diffusion, the surface contact of contaminants, and solvent flow through
   the catalyst. These qualities enhance surface reactions important to the
   process. The new catalysts have shown robust physical and chemical
   properties that make them candidates for real applications in polluted
   water decontamination. They exhibited excellent catalytic activity, but
   with a strong pH dependence on the photo efficiency. These results
   suggest that elimination of the ion exchange character of the catalyst
   may improve its performance at various pHs. To address this issue this
   research studied the effects of a topotactic dehydration reaction on
   this new porous material catalyst and comparing their photocatalytic
   activity. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB 2,4,6-Trichlorophenol (TCP) was bioelectrochemically treated in anodic
   and cathodic compartments of two identical dual chambered microbial fuel
   cells MFC-A and MFC-B under anaerobic and aerobic conditions,
   respectively, and energy was recovered in the form of electricity. It
   was observed that MFC-B with bio-cathodic treatment of TCP outcompeted
   the MFC-A with bio-anodic treatment. The maximum power density for MFC-A
   with bio-anode was found to be 446.76 mW/m(2) while for MFC-B with
   bio-cathode it was 1059.58 mW/m(2). The MFC-B consistently showed higher
   coulombic efficiency, power density and chemical oxygen demand removal
   efficiency indicating the better performance of the MFC-B as compared to
   the MFC-A. Scanning electron micrograph also confirmed better
   accumulation of microbes on the anode of MFC-B and hence its better
   performance in terms of energy recovery. Some major genera present in
   the microbial community were quantified using quantitative real-time
   polymerase chain reaction technique. It also confirmed the dominance of
   electroactive species in the bio-anodic sludge of MFC-B over the
   bio-anodic sludge of MFC-A. Cyclic voltammogram also asserted better
   electrochemical activity of the bio-cathode in the treatment of
   chlorinated phenol toxicants in MFC-B system. The study shows that MFC
   can be a viable option in treatment of recalcitrant chemical compounds
   like TCP with the generation of energy in the form of electrical power.

AB In this study, a batch experiment was used to investigate the
   degradation of real evaporative condensing liquid of shale gas
   wastewater (ECLSGW). We showed that compared to the O-3, ultraviolet
   (UV), UV/TiO2, and O-3/UV/TiO2 processes, the O-3/UV process has better
   performance in removing the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total
   organic carbon (TOC) of ECLSGW under the same conditions. The effects of
   initial pH (3-12), ozone flow rate (0.1-0.5 L/min), UV power (15-50 W),
   and reaction time (0-60 min) on the degradation of ECLSGW via the O-3/UV
   process were investigated using a single-factor experiment. Moreover,
   the optimal experimental conditions were obtained using a quadratic
   polynomial prediction model (R-Adj(2)=0.9961) that was obtained from the
   central composite design (CCD) of the response surface methodology
   (RSM). Under optimal experimental conditions, the COD and TOC removal
   efficiency reached 93.12 and 95.5%, respectively. In addition, gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis showed that the O-3/UV process
   could nearly completely mineralize organic pollutants in the ECLSGW.
   Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) were
   identified by manganese dioxide (MnO2) and tert-butanol (TBA). The
   mechanism research showed that (OH)-O-center dot plays an important role
   in the degradation of organic pollutants. In summary, the O-3/UV process
   is an effective method to degrade ECLSGW. (C) 2018 Institution of

AB A visible light active structured photocatalyst consisting of

   catalyst was characterized by spectroscopic and morphological techniques
   evidencing that the preparation method was able to disperse evenly
   anatase Nitrogen-doped TiO2 particles on polystyrene spheres and that
   the structured catalyst can be activated by visible light. The
   photocatalytic tests were driven first in a laboratory scale reactor
   configuration irradiated through visible light emitted by light emitting
   diodes and then using a solar compound' triangular collector based
   reactor for outdoor experiments. The results from laboratory scale
   experiments did not show any photocatalyst deactivation after several

   blue degradation experiments and real wastewater disinfection (92.6%
   indigenous Escherichia coli inactivation after 120 min of irradiation
   time). In outdoor experiments under direct solar light, the structured
   photocatalyst confirmed its efficiency in the inac-tivation of
   indigenous Escherichia coli present in a municipal wastewater (87%
   inactivation after 120 min treatment and 2 kJ/L of cumulative energy per

AB Methylene blue (MB), Methyl violet 2B (MV2B) and NaCl are known as three
   common industrial contaminants. This paper seeks to use electrical
   conductivity (EC) and temperature (T) values to evaluate the
   concentration (C) of these components, rather than using sophisticated
   equipment/procedure that may increase the likelihood of machine/human
   errors. EC and T are measurable parameters with cheap instruments, and
   they also could be monitored in real time. Concentrations between 0 to
   1,100 mg/L are used in order to model the correlation between C, EC and
   T. Three mathematical models are presented in this paper for each
   contaminant. The first model is derived from the average ratio of EC/C,
   and the influence of temperature on EC in constant C is not taken into
   account. The results of this study illustrate that accuracy rate (R)
   would be 0.88, 0.86, 0.88 for MB, MV2B, NaCl, respectively. The second
   and third models indicate the best polynomial relation between C, EC and
   T. These models investigate the effects of temperature variation between
   15 degrees C and 35 degrees C on the correlation between C and EC. R
   values will be increased for MB, MV2B and NaCl. The current study found
   that in the polynomial relation, EC power more than 2 and T power more
   than 1 does not significantly increase the accuracy of models. The
   models can be employed so as to estimate the concentration of these
   three compounds in experimental/practical purposes. This method can be
   developed for experimental/practical applications that deal with
   concentration and TDS measurement. Another important finding is that the
   temperature has a direct effect on the measurements of EC meter, which
   may lead to errors that can be mitigated by the described method. This
   study takes the effect of temperature on the EC readings into
   consideration while the previous similar researches just modeled the
   relationship between EC and TDS by averaging the ratio between the TDS
   and EC values without considering temperature effects.

   (VI), Phosphates (PO43-) and Congo red (CR) as model pollutants. Using
   the batch method, PN-Fe3O4-PEI exhibited a maximum monolayer adsorption
   capacity of 58.4, 13.5 and 71.3 mg g-1 for Cr (VI), PO43- (as P g L-1)
   and CR, respectively and was dependent on temperature and initial
   adsorbate concentration. Kinetic studies revealed that the Elovich
   equation, the pseudo-second order kinetic model and double constant
   equation well described the uptake of Cr(VI), PO43- and CR onto
   PN-Fe3O4-PEI, respectively. These results may confirm the uptake of
   these pollutants to be mainly driven by chemical forces. In addition,
   PN-Fe3O4PEI was observed to be efficient for the decontamination of the
   studied pollutants in real water samples as well as exhibit
   antibacterial properties towards the growth of S. aureus. These
   properties of PN-Fe3O4-PEI with its other excellent features such as
   high stability in solution, good regeneration properties and its facile
   retrieval from the solution using a magnet promote its suitability for
   practical wastewater treatment.

AB The sulfonated graphene nanosheets were prepared from graphene oxides.
   The kinetic and thermodynamic adsorption of 1-naphthol from aqueous
   solution on the sulfonated graphene nanosheets were investigated under
   ambient conditions. The results of 1-naphthol kinetic adsorption on
   sulfonated graphene indicated that the adsorption was inclined to stack
   on the surface of graphene nanosheets with low activation energy. The
   thermodynamic parameters calculated from the temperature dependent
   adsorption isotherms indicated that the adsorption was a spontaneous and
   endothermic process, and the adsorption was in good agreement with the
   theory of non-bonding interaction intensity. The adsorption capacities
   of 1-naphthol on sulfonated graphene nanosheets are similar to 2.3
   mmol/g at 293.15K, and similar to 6.4 mmol/g at 313.15 and 333.15 K.
   which are the highest adsorption capacity of todays' nano-materials. The
   results suggest that the sulfonated graphene nanosheets may be a
   promising suitable candidate for the preconcentration of 1-naphthol from
   large volume of aqueous solutions in real work in near future. (C) 2011

   refractory organic pollutants owing to the generation of sulfate radical
   (SO4 center dot-) with high standard redox potential. In this study,
   manganese oxide octahedral molecular sieve (OMS-2) with cryptomelane
   type was synthesized by a new hydrothermal method to activate PMS for
   the degradation of phenol and methylene blue (MB) in water. The
   as-prepared composites were fully characterized, and the effects of PMS
   dosage, OMS-2 dosage, initial pollutant concentration, pH, and chloride
   on the degradation of phenol were elaborately investigated. Moreover,
   the phenol degradation was evaluated through the variations of total
   organic carbon (TOC) and three-dimensional excitation emission matrix
   (3D-EEM), and reaction intermediates were also investigated. Both
   electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra and comparative experiments
   suggested SO4 center dot- and hydroxyl radical (HO center dot) took part
   in the phenol degradation and SO4 center dot- was more significant than
   HO center dot. The fine degradation efficiency of phenol in different
   water source, as well as the stability after continuous use, indicated
   the possible application of PMS/OMS-2 in real wastewater treatment.

   a pollutant in aqueous solutions using two different advanced oxidation
   processes; catalytic ozonation in the dark (TiO2/O-3) and in the
   presence of UVA illumination (TiO2/O-3/UVA). The oxidation experiments
   were conducted in deionised water and in a real wastewater sample using
   a falling film reactor. The utilised electrical energy per order (E-EO)
   under different oxidation conditions was calculated to investigate the
   cost effectiveness of the studied oxidation processes with regard to the
   electrical energy consumed by the treatments. It was observed that the
   oxidation of TBA by photocatalytic ozonation systems follows
   pseudo-first-order kinetic with respect to the concentration of TBA. The
   presence of metallic ions and increase of ozone and TBA concentration in
   the oxidation medium led to an increase of the oxidation rate of TBA in
   water. Catalytic ozonation in the dark showed the best cost
   effectiveness among the other oxidation conditions in the degradation of
   TBA in wastewater, with a consumed electrical energy of 12 kW/m(3)

   responses i.e. % Degradation and energy consumption for quadratic
   suggested by BBD under RSM advocates a good correlation between
   predicted and experimental data. The maximum % Degradation and energy
   consumption at optimized were found to be 91.2%, 51.53 kWh m(-3) for
   urea respectively. Additionally, efforts were made to minimize treatment
   time further by implementing a dual effect, namely
   photo-electrocatalysis. The anode was found to be relatively stable even
   after 120 runs. The analysis of treated urea solution was verified in
   terms of total organic carbon (TOC) 90.0% reduction. The average
   operating cost of the electro-oxidation treatment process is determined
   to be 1.91 $ m(-3). The results of this study demonstrate the potential

   prepared and used to degrade heavy oil refinery wastewater (HORW) by
   catalytic ozonation with the aim to develop low-cost and high-efficient
   supported-catalysts for degrading real recalcitrant industrial
   wastewater. Supported-catalyst CuO/AC was characterized by X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), N-2-physisorption, scanning electronic microscope
   (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), and X-ray fluorescence
   (XRF). The degradation was mainly evaluated by chemical oxygen demand
   (COD), total organic carbon (TOC), 5-day biochemical oxygen demand
   (BOD5), biodegradability and toxicity. Compared with
   unsupported-catalyst CuO or the mixed system of activated-AC and
   unsupported-catalyst CuO, supported-catalyst CuO/AC with reduced cost
   exhibited significantly enhanced activity for degrading HORW (5.0 g
   CuO-5%/AC, 90 mg/L O-3, and 7.3 pH). TEM analysis showed that the high
   activity of supported-catalyst CuO-5%/AC might be ascribed to the fact
   that CuO particles were small and highly dispersed on AC. Mass spectrum
   spectrometry (MS) analysis revealed that the organic components in HORW
   were first degraded to small molecule oxidation products, which were
   then oxidized or mineralized further. The influence of CuO loading,
   CuO/AC dose, ozone dose and initial pH on the degradation efficiency was
   also investigated. The results of the present work showed that CuO/AC
   could be a promising supported-catalyst for catalyzing ozonation
   degradation of HORW.

AB Photocatalytic activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) by graphitic carbon
   nitride (g-C3N4) is emerging as a sulfate radical anion based advanced
   oxidation process (S-AOP) for degradation of organic pollutants.
   Importantly, photocatalytic activation of PMS by g-C3N4 is energy
   intensive as light irradiation requires high electrical energy. Here, we
   studied activation of PMS by g-C3N4 under 400 nm light emitting diode
   (LED) irradiation (g-C3N4/PMS/400-LED system) for degradation of Acid
   Orange 7 (AO7). LED array having optical emission maximum around 400 nm
   (FWHM = 16 nm), with electrical input power of 1.54 W (14 V and 110 mA)
   was used for irradiation. Pseudo-first order rate constant (k(obs))
   value for degradation of AO7 by g-C3N4/PMS/400-LED system was determined
   to be 0.094 min(-1). O-2(center dot-), SO4 center dot- were revealed by
   radical scavenging and ESR investigations. k(obs) value in simulated
   ground and real tap water were determined to be 0.068 min(-1) and 0.063
   min(-1), respectively. g-C3N4 was stable, and reused four times without
   any significant loss in its photocatalytic activity. Importantly,
   electrical energy per order (EEO) for degradation of AO7 by
   g-C3N4/PMS/400-LED system was determined to be 24.51 kWh m(-3)
   order(-1). In contrast, the EEO value for the degradation of AO7 by
   g-C3N4 activated PMS under visible light irradiation (>400 nm), using
   conventional xenon lamp, (g-C3N4/PMS/Vis-Xe system) was found to be very
   high as 2702 kWh m(-3) order(-1). Thus, the study highlights, LED
   irradiation source is promising for the development of energy efficient
   g-C3N4 photocatalytic activation of PMS for removal of organic
   pollutants.

AB The performance of a multistage treatment system for textile wastewater
   was investigated in this study. The processes of electrocoagulation
   (EC), photo-Fenton oxidation, and activated sludge biological
   degradation were integrated in batch mode. The integrated treatment
   system performance was assessed according to three response variables:
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and
   biodegradability index. Based on preliminary tests, the EC-based
   wastewater treatment was suitable as the first stage of the integrated
   treatment system, followed by the photo-Fenton process. A lab
   photo-reactor was used to assess the influence of photo-Fenton variables
   on the process performance. Based on the better lab photo-Fenton reactor
   conditions, the improvement of some biological indicators related to the
   organics biodegradability of treated wastewater was investigated in a
   pilot-scale photoreactor. An activated sludge-based biological reactor
   at lab-scale was used as a final treatment stage, in order to achieve
   the legislated limits for discharge into water bodies. Partial
   degradation of the organic pollutants was achieved by the EC process,
   with a 36% reduction in COD. In the second treatment stage, a 70%
   biodegradability index was attained by setting the photo-Fenton reaction
   conditions at 100 mg Fe2+ L-1, pH 2.8, 12 mM H2O2 and 6.9 kJ L-1
   accumulated energy. Finally, a residual COD of 139 mg O-2 L-1 was
   achieved at the outlet of the biological process, which is below the
   maximum limit established by the Portuguese legislation. (C) 2014

AB Accessibility to quality and clean water has in recent times been
   compromised due to the presence of pollutants, thus posing as a threat
   to the survival of living organisms. The adsorption technique in this
   regard has been observed to be useful in the remediation process with
   the material used as the adsorbent playing an integral role. In this
   study, a novel biocomposite (PN-Fe3O4-IDA-Al) based on peanut husk (a
   lowcost material) was developed by functionalization with aluminum (Al),
   iminodiacetic acid (IDA) and Fe3O4. The efficiency of PN-Fe3O4-IDA-Al as
   an adsorbent for the remediation of wastewater was evaluated using Congo
   red (CR) and phosphates (PO43-) as model pollutants. The results from
   the characterization studies confirmed PN-Fe3O4-IDA-Al to have
   superparamagnetic properties which ensures its easy retrieval.
   Adsorption studies indicated that PN-Fe3O4-IDA-Al had a maximum
   monolayer capacity of 79.0 +/- 2.0 and 16.8 +/- 2.5 mg g-1 for CR and
   PO43- (according to P), respectively, which was significantly dependent
   on factors such as reaction time, solution pH, temperature and the
   presence of some common anions. The Freundlich model was observed to
   better describe both adsorption processes with chemisorption being the
   principal underlying mechanism. Results from using real water samples
   confirmed PNFe3O4-IDA-Al to be highly efficient for practical
   remediation processes. These results coupled with the synthesis of
   PN-Fe3O4-IDA-Al under benign conditions using low-cost materials help to
   expound the knowledge on the use of low cost materials as the basis for
   the development of highly efficient adsorbents for wastewater
   remediation. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study was focused on creating a new and effective immobilization
   method for Trametes versicolor laccase (Lc) by using chitosan (CS)
   microspheres activated with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)
   carbodiimide hydrochloride. The activation of the support alternated
   with immobilization of the enzyme, in repetitive procedures, led to
   obtaining three different products. Also, the physicochemical properties
   of the new products were investigated and compared with those of free
   laccase. The discoloration and reusability properties of the immobilized
   Lc were evaluated using indigo carmine (IC) as a model micropollutant.
   The ESEM and FT-IR methods demonstrated that the Lc was successfully
   immobilized. The relative reaction rate and the total amount of
   immobilized Lc were tripled using the iterative protocol as proved by
   specific and Bradford assays. The maximum amount of immobilized Lc was
   8.4 mg Lc/g CS corresponding to the third immobilization procedure.
   Compared to the free Lc, the operational stability of the immobilized Lc
   was significantly improved, presenting a maximum activity plateau over a
   pH range of 3-5 and a temperature range of 25-50 degrees C. The thermal
   inactivation study at 55 degrees C proved that the immobilized enzyme is
   three times more stable than the free Lc. The isoconversional and
   Michaelis-Menten methods showed that the immobilization did not affect
   the enzyme catalytic properties. After 32 days of storage, the residual
   activities are 85% for the immobilized laccase and 40% for the free one.
   In similar conditions, the free and immobilized Lc (2.12 x 10(-6) M)
   completely decolorized IC (7.15 x 10(5) M) within 14 min. The
   immobilized Lc activity remained almost constant (80%) during 10
   reusability cycles. All these results highlight the substantial
   advantages of the new immobilization protocol and demonstrate that
   immobilized Lc can be used as a promising micropollutant removal from
   real wastewater.

AB The rising water-use intensity, and lack of cost-effective treatment
   strategy and reuse of hydraulic fracturing flowback (HFF) has become an
   increasing cause of concern. The present work evaluates the integration
   of parallel sets of tandem anaerobic-oxic membrane bioreactor (AMBR)
   with and without nano-Fe for treatment and reuse of real HFF obtained
   from Ordos Basin, China. Treatment efficiencies in terms of organic
   conversions, micro-pollutants degradation, resource recovery, and
   effects of nano-Fe release on membrane fouling were evaluated. Nano-Fe
   mediated AMBR (FAMBR) system effectively reduce target micro-pollutants
   (such as Acenaphthylene) at 94.4 % compared to the parallel AMBR system
   (17.1 % without nano-Fe). Moreover, recovery of potential economic
   chemicals like Al and P (1.0 and 0.6 mg/g spent nano-Fe) availed using
   FAMBR system. However, colonization of FAMBR membrane surface by
   Fe-protein/peptide hydroxocomplexes initiated by Fe-catalyzed microbial
   extrusions present a huge fouling challenge relative to the AMBR system.
   Additional evidences from microscopic/spectroscopic analysis of the
   FAMBR membrane system revealed that despite having a promising outlook,
   mediation of nano-Fe with AMBR system might result in a major fouling
   event during HFF treatment. Engineered design of nano-Fe to reduced
   leached nano-Fe ions in pre-treatment step prior to AMBR treatment
   system may be of potential research consideration.

TI Use of pipe deposits from water networks as novel catalysts in paraquat

AB The present work intends to evaluate the possibility of using real pipe
   deposits as peroxidation catalysts (i.e., in the heterogeneous
   Fenton-like oxidation process) to degrade the pesticide paraquat in
   water. The valorisation of these loosely or firmly attached materials,
   often discarded after networks cleaning or maintenance, respectively, is
   envisaged in off-line waste water treatment applications. They may
   however be also applicable in situ, for instance in case of a
   contamination event of water networks.
   Four iron-containing real deposits, herein called S1, S2, S3 and S4,
   were considered. The results revealed that two of them (samples S1 and
   S2) exhibit good catalytic performance in the pesticide degradation and
   mineralization. Another one (sample S3) has goethite and also some
   metals in its composition that can decompose the hydrogen peroxide,
   compromising the peroxidation process. The calcium rich deposit, S4, is
   only useful as catalyst when the medium pH is adjusted to the required
   acidic values of Fenton's reaction. Even so, other deposits showed good
   performances even at neutral pH values, which is related with their low
   pH(pzc) values. It was found that depending on the solid nature, the
   catalytic performance can be predominantly due to the presence of the
   solid phase, but in some cases the homogenous process resulting from
   leached ions play an important role. With the deposit that exhibited the
   best performance, an exhaustive study of the pH effect was done, showing
   the stability of these materials at neutral conditions. (C) 2012

AB Nitrogen-doped carbon quantum dots (N-CQDs) were successfully
   synthesized using rice residue and glycine as carbon and nitrogen
   sources by one-step hydrothermal method. High quantum yield (23.48%)
   originated from the effective combination of nitrogen with various
   functional groups (C=O, N-H, C-N, COOH and C-O-C). The N-CQDs showed a
   fluorescence with the wavelength varied from 420 to 500 nm and the
   maximum emission wavelength being at 440 nm. N-CQDs have been
   importantly applied as probe to detect Fe3+ and tetracycline (TCs)
   antibiotics with remarkable performance. Using the linear relationship
   between fluorescence intensity and Fe3+ concentration, the N-CQDs could
   be employed as a simple, efficient sensor for ultrasensitive Fe3+
   detection ranging from 3.32 to 32.26 mu M, with a limit of detection
   (LOD) of 0.7462 mu M. The N-CQDs showed the applicability to detect TCs.
   The detection limits of tetracycline, terramycin and chlortetracycline
   were 0.2367, 0.3739 and 0.2791 mu M, respectively. The results of TC by
   fluorescence method in real water samples were in good agreement with
   standard Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) method. The N-CQDs have various
   potential applications including sensitive and selective detection of
   Fe3+ and TCs, and cellular imaging with low cytotoxicity, good
   biocompatibility and high permeability. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All

AB In this work, a Fenton-like system with MnOx-Fe3O4/biochar composite
   (FeMn/biochar) and reducing agents (RAs) was constructed for pollutant
   degradation, aiming to enhance Fenton-like performance from both
   degradation efficacy and operational cost aspects. Batch experiments
   revealed that five well-characterized RAs (sodium borohydride (SBH),
   sodium thiosulfate (STS), ascorbic acid (AA), hydroxylamine (HA) and
   oxalic acid (OA)) could impact performance of FeMn/biochar-H2O2 system
   through multiple mechanisms, including variation of solution pH,
   competition for H2O2, electrostatic attraction and acceleration of metal
   redox cycle. Significantly, only OA and HA obviously enhanced the
   catalytic capacity of Fenton-like process and HA increased ciprofloxacin
   degradation efficiency from 38.2% to 92.8% with a low economic
   consumption as 4.16 US$/m(3), well in agreement with the accelerated
   Fe(III/II) cycle and Mn(III/II) cycle in FeMn/biochar-H2O2-HA system.
   The accelerated metal redox cycle could enhance the decomposition of
   H2O2 into center dot OH and center dot O-2(-), which were verified to be
   the main reactive oxygen species responsible for ciprofloxacin
   degradation by radical trapping experiments. Meanwhile,
   FeMn/biochar-H2O2-HA system could also work effectively in real
   wastewaters, and exhibited favorable catalytic performance towards
   oxytetracycline, tetracycline, methyl orange, methylene blue, Rhodamine
   B, and naphthalene, indicating the applicability of FeMn/biochar-H2O2-HA
   system in oxidizing refractory pollutants in wastewaters.

AB The aim of this research was to optimize and model the synthesis and
   application of a novel visible-light-driven Ag/C-TiO(2)nanophotocatalyst
   for degradation of recombinant DNA in Hepatitis B surface antigen
   production plant wastewater. The synthesized nanoparticles were
   characterized using X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra, field emission
   scanning electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy.
   The effects of the dopant content of silver and carbon, calcination
   temperature, heating rate, initial recombinant DNA copy number, pH
   value, and contact time were evaluated experimentally and optimized
   separately as the synthesis and operational parameters. Application of
   response surface methodology showed the optimum values of Ag content, C
   content, calcination temperature, and the heating rate as 2.2 wt%, 0.06
   wt%, 444 degrees C, and 12 degrees C/min, respectively. Synthesized
   nanoparticles resulted in 60% recombinant DNA degradation at the
   optimized operation conditions experimentally (i.e., pH of 5.5, contact
   time of 24 h, and the maximum initial recombinant DNA concentration of
   2.12E13 copy number in 200 mL wastewater). The synthesis and operating
   quadratic models adequately predicted the experimental data. The
   statistical analysis showed that the square of carbon dopant content,
   calcination temperature, initial recombinant DNA concentration, and
   contact time had the greatest effects on the recombinant DNA
   degradation.

AB Citrate and polyvinyl alcohol capped gold nanoparticles (PVA-GNPs) were
   synthesized via chemical reduction technique and fully characterized by
   DLS, SEM, EDS, XRD, UV-Vis and FT-IR analysis. A simple and practical
   colorimetric sensor based on red-ox reaction of
   p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde (DABA) as ehrlich's bioreagent and Au(III)
   with H2O2 on PVA-GNPs mimic catalyst with enzyme-like activity, has been
   fabricated for determination of F-, Br- and I- halide anions. Prepared
   PVA-GNPs, can simultaneously catalyze the disintegration of H2O2, that
   used to reduce Au(III) ions into co-doped Au-NPs and oxidation of
   p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde ehrlich's bio-reagent while in the presence
   of halide ions Au-X complex can be formed and improved sensor
   selectivity. Halide ions (F-, Br- and I-) effectively diminishes the
   catalytic activity of GNPs to disintegrate oxygenated water by the
   interaction among Au+ and Au-0 and suppressing oxidation of
   p-\dimethylaminobenzaldehyde ehrlich's bio-reagent. In this system which
   contains PVA-GNPs, H2O2, p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde ehrlich's
   bio-reagent, and Au(III), increasing the halide ions (F , Br and 1 )
   concentration show color changes from deep green to red. In view of this
   rule, in this work, a novel colorimetric technique for sensitive
   determination of F-, Br- and I- was developed. This method has the
   detection limits of 2.60 x 10(-6) M, 6.64 x 10(-8) M and 9.93 x 10(-9) M
   and linear ranges between 1.98 x 10(-5)-122 x 10(-3) M, 1.99 x
   10(-6)-2.0 x 10(-4)M and 1.07 x 10(-7)- 2.86 x 10(-5)M for F-, Br- and
   I-, respectively. Assays are highly selective over other ions. They
   effectively applied to detection of halide ions in real water samples.
